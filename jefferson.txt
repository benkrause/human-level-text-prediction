canada by mcclelland and stewart limited printed in the united states of america this r work as a whole is for elisabeth gifford malone this volume is for the university of virginia introduction about twenty years ago i promised myself that i would write a big xa book about thomas jefferson someday i was teaching history at the university of virginia which he founded and any time that i wanted to i could look up and see monticello in the dim distance in the community they continued to repeat a remark of a discerning ex president of the united states who had once lectured there in that place said william howard taft they still talked of mr jefferson as though he were in the next room he was there unquestionably whether or not any of us really understood what he was saying and in youthful presumptuousness i flattered myself that sometime i would fully comprehend and encompass him i do not claim that i have yet done so and i do not believe that i or any other single person ever can nobody can live jeffersons long and eventful life all over again and nobody in our age is likely to match his universality i have not devoted all these intervening years to him until his two hundredth anniversary in my longest period of concentrated at tention was about six months otherwise i worked on him only as occa sion offered and occasion offered considerably less time than i had expected my total labors added up to a good many months but they suffered from the fact that they were discontinuous i wrote a few things about him but others wrote more and my small contributions now seem hardly worth mentioning since i have been able to give most of my time to him under circumstances which call for grateful acknowledgment elsewhere as a result here is a volume covering the first major period of his life another covering a second period is just behind it and god willing there will eventually be two more after these i have entitled the work as a whole jefferson and his time and am venturing to call it a comprehensive biography hoping that it will seem reasonably commensurate with the achievements and the stature of the man there can be no possible question that jefferson deserves extended and careful treatment the memorial in washington which was dedi cated on his two hundredth anniversary is tangible evidence of his rec ognized membership in the trinity of american immortals along with vul introduction george washington and abraham lincoln others may deserve to stand beside them but the supreme eminence of these three is practi cally unchallenged at the present time washington is the major sym bol of the independent republic itself lincoln of the preserved union but jefferson surpassed both of them in the rich diversity of his achieve ments no historic american except possibly benjamin franklin played so notable a part in so many important fields of activity and thought government law religion education agriculture architecture science philosophy jefferson did not have franklins spicy wit and does not offer quite such delightful companionship but it is doubtful if any other public man in all our annals is equally interesting to so many sorts of minds he was never regarded as the first citizen of the world as woodrow wilson indubitably was for a brief time but after the pass ing of franklin and washington no american of his period matched him in international reputation and as a major apostle of individual freedom and human dignity he has long belonged not merely to his own compatriots but to the human race his fame is probably greater in our generation than it has been at any other time since his death in this country it was dimmed toward the middle of the nineteenth century when slaveholders tended to deride his sayings about human equality and unionists to deplore his emphasis on state rights it is ironic that the most extensive account of him appeared at that time the massive threevolume life by henry s randall was issued shortly before the civil war jeffersons reputa tion has grown enormously since then especially in the years since the first world war in the very recent past when totalitarianism threat ened to engulf the world mens minds inevitably turned back to this foe of every kind of tyranny much has been written about him lately but no biography has yet matched randalls in scope and impressiveness the explanation is not to be found in lack of interest but i believe in the recognized complexity of the subject and die difficulty of ex ploring the vast materials jeffersons public career is inextricably en twined with the history of an entire era and his diverse interests are bewildering to the minds of our age which are universal in the aggre gate but highly specialized in individuals the body of materials relating to his life and times is immense no one has yet exploited the whole of it and quite obviously no single person ever can jeffersons career is still a challenge to the investigator as well as to the interpreter previous research has hardly made the task of the biographer easy but numerous developments in recent years have made it less difficult without going into details at this point i can say and it would be most unjust and ungrateful in me not to say that many scholars have introduction he surveyed portions of this vast field and that many writers have illumi nated various aspects of jeffersons genius and particular periods of his long and active life some of these studies are classics of their kind i certainly intend no reflection on them when i say that they leave some gaps and that they need to be supplemented assessed and integrated in order that a larger synthesis shall result in our generation also notable progress has been made in organizing the various manuscript collections bearing on jefferson his own papers were divided and some of them were widely scattered after randalls day and they have never been reassembled in a single place but new and better guides and indexes have been prepared and while film and photostat have not relieved the investigator of the necessity of very great labor they do enable him to go faster and farther than before thus the times and the cooperation conscious or unconscious of a large number of people make it possible to write a fuller story about jefferson than has previously been told any biographical or historical work must be described in relative terms although i have termed this one comprehensive i do not make the presumptuous claim that it is final or the absurd one that it is complete others will interpret the same man and the same events differently this is practically inevitable since he was a central figure in historic controversies which are still echoing a great deal more will be said about him after i am done an edition of his papers is now being prepared under the skillful direc tion of julian p boyd and this will be published in upwards of fifty volumes by the princeton university press this magnificent collec tion has been a great boon to me and i take comfort in the thought that anyone who wants to fill the inevitable gaps in my narrative can have recourse to it later on my biography contains a great many facts too many some may think and i hope it can be consulted with confidence but my purpose has not been to compile a book of reference this first of my four projected volumes which i am calling jeffer son the virginian covers almost half of his life by chronological meas urement the fortyone years ending with his departure for france after the death of his wife and the close of the american revolution mar k a clearly defined period in his private and public life no other volume will cover so many years although the second takes in more territory in the second period he went on a mis sion to france criticized european civilization and enjoyed european culture returned to america became secretary of state battled against hamilton retired to monticello became the acknowledged leader of a party ran second to john adams and became vice president and was x introduction finally elected president himself this time roughly that of the french revolution was the most agitated and on the whole probably the most unhappy of his incessantly active and generally happy life the third volume will cover his presidency the fourth will carry him through his years of retirement and in intellectual and spiritual content it should be the richest of them all i shall refer to jeffersons more important intellectual literary and artistic activities at appropriate points in this story but i cannot sum them up until the evidence is all in since many loose strings must be left dangling i hope it will be remembered that i intend to tie them up at the end my major purposes for the work are that it shall be comprehensive that it shall relate jeffersons career to his age and that it shall be true to his own chronology as a result it will be long it will be historical it can hardly be anything else and it will be primarily a narrative by comprehensive i mean something more than the desire to com prehend the labors of other scholars i have sought to see the whole of a manysided man this is no special brand of biography political or intellectual or anything else it was chiefly as a public official that jeffer son became eminent but he was philosophical in spirit avid in scientific curiosity deeply concerned with freeing the minds and enriching the ves of men he was all this before he became publicly conspicuous and no part of the early story is more important than the development of his mind and personal interests although i shall have to postpone final consideration of various intellectual and artistic matters i have tried to see the man in just proportions at each successive stage t is as important to understand the historical circumstances which surrounded and affected jefferson as it is to ascertain the part he him self played in movements and events the two tasks are inseparable but the latter is so exacting in itself that any biographer is likely to neglect the former i have tried to acquaint myself with jeffersons major contemporaries to become aware of the changing climates of opinion in his long age to be cognizant not only of the shifting states and economics but also of science philosophy and the arts all this must be regarded as the expression of an ideal for i do not flatter myself that i can fill this large order by keeping this account of jefferson true to his own chronology i mean that i have not viewed him as a static personality like a portkt on the wall but as a living growing changing man riwaysxme person but never quite the same since ther was a distinct core of con ancy in his thought many of the changes are mote apparent than teal ami can be largely explained in terms of varying circumstances one of tile advantages of a strict regard for chronology is thi the introduction xi major features of his mind and character can be observed before their outlines were obscured by political controversy it is easier to reach a confident opinion about the sort of man he was in than to do so for or in my opinion he did not change fundamentally but unquestionably there were differences in expression and these have seemed to some observers to amount to contradictions if he was notably constant in his pursuit of major ends he was flexible about minor ones and became more so as he proceeded to some discerning observers he has seemed an elusive personality henry adams posed the problem better than anybody else has done when he said that jef ferson could be painted only touch by touch with a fine pencil and the perfection of the likeness depended upon the shifting and uncer tain flicker of its semitransparent shadows it has seemed to me that the only way to catch the real likeness of the man is to watch his picture grow until it assumes its essential outline and then to watch it change as time and circumstance employ a fine pencil he loses none of his fas cination but he does lose much of his elusiveness when one follows him through life the way he himself went through it that is chronologically in this volume we follow him through fortyone years during more than half of that time he was growing up going to school reading law fitting himself for his inherited station as a leading planter of the prov ince of virginia then he practised his profession while acquiring fur ther legal learning performed the public duties which went with his position in society began to build a famous house made a happy and advantageous marriage and started a family he was at the height of his private fortune and personal happiness in his early thirties when the storm of the american revolution gathered and broke and being a patriot by conviction he devoted himself largely though not wholly to public tasks for the next ten years disregarding the first thirty years for the moment i will comment briefly on the nature of the services which really started him on the road to historical immortality the american revolution precipitated his public genius and the most important external fact to which his early career must be related is the fact of war this was not a brilliant or swiftmoving conflict it was a slow and tedious struggle demanding infinite faith and patience from the small group of leaders who carried it through jefferson be lieved that he was sharing in cosmic events in this era and in the perspec tive of history he undoubtedly was besides starting the republic on its independent course the war ushered in an age of revolution which affected the whole of the western world and which did not end until history of the united states i xn introduction jefferson himself had grown old the sort of faith it called for he had in rare measure and maintained afterwards more persistently than al most any other leader this in itself is a supremely important historical fact with a few very conspicuous exceptions however his activities did not strike his contemporaries as epochmaking or deeply stir ring during his governorship of virginia toward the end of the war circumstances could hardly have failed to make him inglorious and practically all the rest of his services were performed as a legislator in the house of burgesses and house of delegates of virginia and in the continental congress sitting on endless committees and doing a vast amount of paper work it was not as a commander like washington nor as a fiery orator like patrick henry that he gained his chief title to fame it was as the draftsman of state papers and legislative bills and legal statutes he rarely had a continental audience and only the passage of slow time could reveal the full significance of proposals rejected when he made them and of words more famous now than they were then jefferson himself thought his authorship of the declaration of inde pendence and the virginia statute for religious freedom more deserv ing of remembrance than his presidency of the united states he be came much more conspicuous after the american revolution than he ever was during it but his services to his fellow men never again squared quite so well with his fundamental principles and on the whole those principles have fared well at the hands of time if the essence of his greatness lies in the fact that he applied to the shifting problems of his age an enlightened and humane philosophy there was no other period when his purposes shone forth with the same purity or the fun damentals of his philosophy seemed so clear other periods of his life may seem more eventful but only in retirement does he again reveal such a high degree of philosophical detachment the clue to his pur poses must be sought in his own mind and that developed in no vacuum but in a particular place at a definite time if we would genu inely understand him and his career therefore we must view him first at home source materials for jeffersons boyhood youth and young man hood are scanty they begin to be abundant when he became governor of virginia at the age of thirtysix and they become progressively richer as the years go by though the sources are most meager for the years before he was thirty i have managed to uncover some fresh details of fact about this difficult period and i am sorely tempted to list them however this would be to exaggerate their significance and introduction xlll i rest content with the hope that the early story will seem somewhat fuller and truer as the result of these relatively unrewarding labors the important task at the beginning is to put the young man properly in his setting of place and time and to point out his distinctiveness in comparison with his contemporaries jeffersons relations with vir ginia and virginians are traced at considerable length in a number of chapters in this book but since the treatment is generally chronologi cal and may seem at places to move forward by inches it seems desir able at this point to summarize some of the general conclusions i have reached during the american revolution when jefferson said my coun try he meant virginia he was not unique in this respect and the expression in itself implies no exaggerated emphasis on the state as a unit of government during this period actually he was notable among his countrymen for his devotion to the cause of the feeble union but he was a virginian before he became anything else and he never ceased to be one he was deeply rooted in that soil ancestors of his had lived in the colony for at least three generations before him he received the whole of his formal education there and until he was forty he had spent scarcely a year outside of the borders of the prov ince and state his own country was almost the only scene of his activity until he had entered into middle life and if he did not know more about it than anybody else he described it in his notes on vir ginia far more fully than anyone else had ever done he was by no means uncritical of virginia during the american revolution however and at various times he sharply condemned cer tain aspects of its aristocracy these comments and some of his own later actions have led many writers to draw a sharp contrast between the man and his environment to many people it has seemed paradoxi cal that a famous advocate of human liberty and a patron saint of de mocracy should have arisen from a society which was based on slavery and was aristocratic in its tone in the effort to resolve the seeming paradox some writers have taken the position in effect that he was an alien in this society from the time that he began to think some have gone back even further accepting far too readily traditions about his fathers origins which must now be modified and attributing his democ racy vaguely to the influence of the frontier which for some inex plicable reason did not have a similar effect on john marshall the chief faults of this school of thinking are the tendency to read back into one period the issues of another the failure to allow sufficiently for the development of jeffersons own ideas and an imperfect under xiv introduction standing not merely of his personal background but also of the society of virginia before die american revolution certain writers on the other hand have gone to such pains to dem onstrate the high social position of jeffersons ancestors and have so emphasized the refinement of his own tastes as to imply that except for his greater intellectual and artistic interests there was litde real difference between him and his aristocratic fellows during this early period in my own opinion the main personal difference between him and the best of diem was one of degree i am not disposed to elevate him by depressing them my association in spirit with the leaders of the province of virginia before the revolution has given me too much respect for them for that but one should not beg the question of his fundamental political attitude or give the impression that he was pri marily a fine gentleman who was incidentally concerned with the ad vancement of mankind and who in his own person was something of a snob he never ceased to prefer the companionship of superior minds and to prize good manners but broad social sympathy was basic in his life he was born to a privileged position but from the beginning of his important public career he opposed all the artificialities of aristoc racy only in the sense that he believed that society should be gov erned by those who are really the best qualified can he possibly be regarded as a political aristocrat and it did not take him long to dis cover that native ability and high character are the sole possession of no class in my opinion however jefferson was not violently at war with the dominant forces in his local environment at this or any other time there was no need for such an optimist to be in a hurry he was con fident that time was fighting for his ideas and that human progress was certain if only tyranny and artificial obstructions were removed in the course of the revolution he effected certain fundamental reforms in landtenure but these longrange proposals were not strongly com batted by the conservatives he advocated colonial selfgovernment from the beginning but many other landholders were equally radical in this respect he was considerably in advance of dominant opinion in his desire to broaden the base of representation but this in itself did not make him a modem democrat if he must be given a single designation he was a liberal liberty was his chief concern and his major emphasis was on the freedom of the spirit and the mind of all his revolutionary measures in virginia the ones he cherished most were his statute for religious freedom which have summed this matter up in an article entitled the great generation virginia quarterly review winter pp introduction he coupled with entire intellectual freedom and his unsuccessful bills for the wider diffusion of knowledge by means of public education this cultivated gentleman who always indulged his scientific literary and esthetic tastes was a lifelong advocate of liberty for all and of education for all in proportion to their merit to call him an enlight ened liberal is the best way to sum him up in the first stage of great career and to set him in his native society and the thought currents of his time his distinctiveness does not lie in the fact that he roundly con demned the society in which he occupied an assured position for in the early stages of his career he did not do that he was distinctive because he combined within himself the highest virtues of his native society excepting the military while escaping its chief vices from the beginning he showed the strong sense of public responsibility which was so characteristic of his social order and he had the large ness of view which was so generally found among the leading vir ginians he gladly emulated the good manners of these gentlemen but their alleged indolence and their historic love of gaming did not appear in his character or conduct intellectually he exemplified more conspicuously than any of his fellows the liberal and humane spirit the incessant scientific curiosity and zeal for universal knowledge and the fundamental belief in the powers of human intelligence which characterized what historians call the enlightenment he must be described as a virginian and anyone should have been proud to be one in the greatest age of the province and state but he has a further distinction after benjamin frankliix he may be regarded as the fullest american embodiment of the ideals of the enlightenment both in his intellectual and his public life he represented them in action this he did not merely in the years of the american revolution when the climate of ideas was favorable butt also in the more conservative period which followed then as we shall see in the second volume of this work the reaction became so great that he was thrown on the defensive perhaps it is even more to his credit that he defended enlightened liberalism when it was derided in high places t han that he exemplified it when it was fashionable his personal opinions were subject to change and his policies must be de scribed in relative terms to him however freedom of the mind was an absolute throughout his public career he was a statesman as well as a thinker and since he may not qualify as a philosopher on technical grounds he can be most safely described as a philosophical statesman it is qtite xvi introduction common however for people who do not like him to refer to him as a politician implying that he was skillful in partisan maneuver gifted as an organizer and a master of the art of winning votes in the revo lutionary era however he had no particular reputation for political skill in this modem sense until he returned from france and faced hamilton in washingtons official family he thought of himself and was regarded by others as a personally disinterested public man whose prime concern was the promotion of the public good and who made a special point of avoiding factious quarrels anyone who doubts this is referred to the story of his unfolding career based on contemporary records as told in this and the following volume during the period of the american revolution jefferson did not have to exert himself much as a candidate for office his first election to the virginia house of burgesses at the age of twentyfive was probably engineered by his elders who had matters well in hand and his various reelections to the local legislature were effected as a matter of course generally if not always without any real contest personal influences were doubtless exercised in his behalf before he went to the continental congress but he regarded service in that body more as an obligation than a privilege presumably he was elected governor of virginia by the progressives in the assembly but the grouping was very loose and contemporary comments do not show that he was the head or even the lieutenant of what could properly be called an organ ization if he ever wanted the office which is doubtful he certainly ceased doing so within a very few weeks throughout this entire period jeffersons political strength lay in his many friendships among the leaders of all shades of opinion the vigor and definiteness of his ideas and his reputation as a disinterested and patriotic public servant despite the traditio nal opinion the dis asters which befell him as governor which are dealt with in consider able detail in this volume impaired his local standing for only a very short time and had little or nothing to do with the alleged decline in the spirit of liberalism in the state before he had been formally vindi cated he received an election to congress which he duly declined and it was wholly his own choosing that he did not return to public life sooner than he actually did his fellows were more than anxious to do him honor it would be difficult to prove that he ever exerted him self to secure any political office during this period though he was pleased with his appointment to france and if he had inordinate per sonal ambitions as hamilton afterwards asserted he was remarkably successful in concealing them from his revolutionary contemporaries he unquestionably valued and probably craved public honors as he introduction istvli craved human affection but the sensitiveness of his nature caused trim to abhor controversy and to avoid any that did not center in an im portant idea this is not the sort of stuff out of which partisan leaders are generally made in his young manhood he was of a type with the greatest virginians of the era relatively few of whom were politicians in the narrow sense he assumed responsibilities by virtue of his position a n d abilities and thought of himself as engaged in the conduct of public affairs just ns george washington george mason and george wythe did his con temporaries would have been exceedingly surprised to hear the proph ecy that he would be heralded in future years as one of the greatest party leaders ever to appear in the united states they would not have thought of him as an idol of the masses and this shy and highly intel lectual gentleman might never have got started in politics had lie begun his career in a more democratic age during the revolution however he revealed his unu sual power of political expression and gradually became unconsciously i believe a symbol of ideas which inspired hope among the inarticulate as well as die enlightened others besides him believed that all men were bom free but it was he who phrased the declaration of independence there were other liberals among the privileged landholders but it was he who advocated the abolition of entail and primogeniture who wanted to extend the suffrage and make representation more equitable and who sought vainly to bring some education within the reach of every child he was not the only virginian who had a clear vision of the promise of the vast interior of this continent but before he left tor paris he drew an ordinance which anticipated the great charter of the west before he was widely proclaimed as a great statesman he had showed himself to be a great prophet and time was fighting for him as he was sure it would for his ideas the leaders all knew that he was a devoted and effective public servant at times he may have seemed remote but they also knew him as an amiable man and a loyal friend his sensitiveness to criticism was recognized by some as a weakness but since it was accompanied by a sensitiveness to the feelings of others it was an asset in any private circle and it had certain political uses it led him to be tolerant of minor differences and although it may not have fitted him to be a com mander in a crisis it made him a sympathetic leader of kindred spirits his industry no one could question though he was not personally aggressive and did not become a field soldier he was a man of notable vigor among the patriots and there was no reason to doubt his courage not until much later did his political foes question that his revolu xvlll introduction tionary contemporaries could hardly have failed to detect some flaws in his character for he was not impeccable but they regarded him as a good man and he now appears a little too good if anything there are gleams of dry humor in some of his communications as governor but he had not learned to banter as pleasantly as he did after he went to france and he does not appear to have told many tall tales as yet even in intimate personal letters he used stilted language though that bothered nobody then it was in the manner of the time if it was almost impossible for him to be familiar he was exceedingly domestic concentrating on his little family an intensity of devotion which is unusual among men in his rural society it was natural to center interests and activities in the home which was also the heart of the plantation village but this was specially true of him he was uniformly generous in financial matters solicitous of his mother while she lived and always of his brother and sisters he had already begun to be a collector of books and a patron of promising young men he cultivated as best he could the arts and sciences laid longrange plans for the advancement of society and even after he had suffered unde served disasters as governor and had lost his wife believed that goodness lay at the heart of things part of his inveterate optimism was owing to physical causes he was strong and except for periodic headaches very healthy his admirable digestion helped him attain the serenity he sought he had no desire to be the master of others but he applied the most rigorous discipline to himself that in itself must have made him seem rather formidable as a human being he was a hard man to know intimately and still is but it must have seemed a privilege to know him then as it does now for the privilege of living with him in his age and becoming as well acquainted with him as i have i am

albemarle county virginia at that time the district was in the county of goochland and virginia was a province of king george ii of great britain by the calendar then in effect the birthday was april but according to the new style which was adopted when jefferson was still a boy it was april and thus it has been celebrated through the years this was a delicious season for the air of the virginia piedmont is soft in april the dogwood soon opens in the woods and the wild honeysuckle begins to bloom the house has long since vanished but the site is marked and anybody who goes there now can see that it was well chosen to the southward it overlooks the rivanna river often referred to then as the north river or north branch of the james this is now a muddy and unimpressive stream but it once was purer the prospect to the west is finer for on any clear day the distant blue ridge can be seen through a gap in the southwest mountains the place was called shadwell peter jefferson who owned it had named it for the parish in london where his wife jane randolph had been christened twentythree years before the setting did not suggest the thames basin or hanoverian england however this was not a rainy but generally a sunny land and it had no antiquity or mellow ness for as a seat of settlement it was almost wholly new the hard wood forests which covered the bottom lands and steep hillsides were broken by only a few clearings where the red soil glowed and the first wails of this newborn infant could have been echoed by the howling of the wolves the earliest surroundings of this natural philosopher were beautiful but they were wild jefferson was bom on the fringe jefferson the virginian of western settlement and some will say that he thus became a child of the american frontier no influence upon him was more abiding than that of nature and throughout life he deeply loved this region of wooded hills and lavendertinted mountains but shadwell was not the home of his earliest memories when he was two or three years old he was taken from it to tuckahoe on the james to an older and better house in a more thickly settled district at that time no parts of virginia were thickly settled with a few exceptions the entire province was a vast forest tobacco plantations and their seats were strung loosely along the rivers but to all european observers the clearings seemed small and the country looked uninhabited the vastness of this physical setting was not lost upon thomas jefferson it was reflected in the largeness of his mind furthermore this society as a whole was closer to the frontier than later generations might at first realize but jeffer son was in albemarle only intermittently during his boyhood and he knew the region best after the fringe of settlement had stretched well beyond it he was used to sparsely settled country but he did not know the frontier by experience and though he was always aware of the wilderness he was not in the physical sense an explorer peter jefferson a man of huge stature and legendary strength was in his midthirties in he performed memorable deeds as a sur veyor in uncharted country in later years but at no time was he a typi cal frontiersman he was not yet at the height of his fortunes though he was a slaveowner and he had other lands below the james thirty miles or so to the southeast where he had previously lived he was no landless pioneer but an enterprising young planter who may have ventured a bit too far to the westward in this instance he had been there several years however he had intended to stay and he may already have planned the extensive group of plantation buildings he eventually erected he built only a modest unit at first and it was to this plain house that he had brought his wife and two little daughters the year before his third child and first son was bom jane randolph may not have liked the extreme remoteness of shadwell and probably was glad that her first stay there was short the most important early fact about thomas jefferson is not that fiske kimball in search of jeffersons birthplace virginia magazine of history and biography cited hereafter as va mag li oct note explanation of the abbreviations used in the footnotes and further details concerning the works referred to may be found in symbols and short titles and select critical bibliography following the appendices jeffersons and randolphs he appeared on the edge of settlement but that he was born in the province of virginia and that from his first days he was numbered among its gentry he was not bom to physical hardship as abraham lincoln was he did not know town life from boyhood as benjamin franklin did in the ordinary meaning of the term he was no selfmade man he grew up in the generous society which had been created in a new country and a warm climate by a group of planters cultivating tobacco and relying on slave labor from his earliest memories his financial position was assured and the best educational opportunities which the colony afforded were later available to him he gave chief thanks to his father for all this and he himself would have made peter jefferson the dominant character in his early history but this planta tion society centered in families and thomas jeffersons his tory neces sarily begins as the story of a family or rather of two family and how they merged jeffersons connections stood him in good stead while he was grow ing up and he always valued them on personal grounds but he never spent much of his precious time on the remote subject of genealogy as a young man he was not wholly indifferent to has ancestry but in the ripeness of age he made light of it and there are a number of people now living who know more about it than he did to him the degree of their interest would seem surprising for he was more interested in the origins of laws and institutions than in the beginnings of any par ticular family and he belonged to the school of thought which magni fied the influence of environment and minimized heredity too much probably the progenitor in whom he took greatest pride was his father and this because of what peter jefferson did rather than what he inherited his father was a man of deeds not words but there is indication that this inarticulate squire set considerable store by family traditions the naming of shadwell showed that although jane randolph may have made the original suggestion furthermore he afterwards had a place on the fluvanna river which he called snowden after a mountain in wales near which the jeffersons were supposed once to have lived whether they ever did seems to be beyond the possibility of historical verification and the matter is of no real importance if they were origi nally welsh they had become predominantly english after they had lived for several generations in virginia thomas jeffersons own knowledge of his paternal ancestry went autobiography in p l ford ed writings of thomas jefferson hereafter cited as ford i jefferson the virginian back only to his grandfather after whom he was named the line can be traced with certainty only one step further to an obscure man whom we shall call thomas jefferson i for the purposes of this story he was a farmer naturally enough and by the year he was living in henrico county which was then much larger than it now is considerably below the present location of richmond he was in the curls region so called because of the eccentricities of the james river which in one stretch of six miles managed to meander through sixteen this was in the low and level tidewater country overspread with heavy forests and flowering shrubs where practically all of the vir ginians then were as far to the west as settlers dared go lived an exceedingly enter prising man named william byrd from the falls of the james he dispatched traders into the carolinas to barter with the indians in thomas jefferson i who himself had moved farther westward had a small business transaction with this magnate he bought from him a parcel of land consisting of about one hundred and sixtyseven acres technically he was then a squatter on this very piece of prop erty though the presumption is that nobody thought his conduct at all reprehensible the governor finding that the land had escheated to the king had granted it to another who had assigned it to the acquisitive byrd and the latter at length sold it to the occupant for a valuable consideration the real moral of the tale is that neither in financial power nor worldly wisdom were the early jeffersons a match for the early byrds on the other hand this ancestor of a presi dent must have had some capital and apparently he was not the sort of farmer who could be easily evicted by a richer man presumably this was the place where his son lived afterwards if so it was on the south bank of the river some twenty miles below the falls and strategically situated for a landing at this time there were land barons in virginia to whom such hold in he was taxed for the first time for maintenance of the soldiers being obligated to pay for two tdthables records henrico county court in

small and such a man inconsequential but the heyday of the plantation aristocracy had not yet arrived though the economic and social structure of the colony was taking form it had not attained rigidity life was dispersed and fluid in this spacious country and here for many years yet vigorous and ambitious men had an excel lent chance to rise this was an unequal society in an age of recognized inequality but except for the lowest group the slaves it was not one of rigid caste the road to riches and power lay open to those who acquired land while it was still easy to get and who somehow found labor with which to exploit it the distinct advantage lay with those who had influence and capital labor was always scarcer than land and slaves rather than acreage came to be the major criterion of prosperity but no one had many slaves or much ready money in the late seven teenth century and the status of a small landholder who tilled a virgin soil was far from degraded his life was undoubtedly crude but nature was prodigal and the future beckoned the first thomas jefferson probably had little capital or influence but he went forward on the road to fortune and a genteel station besides bearing and transmitting a good name he increased his hold ings and became a man of respectable estate he acquired no military title but judging from the number of wolf bounties he collected he had some prowess as a hunter he became one of ye surveyours of ye highways thus establishing a tradition in the family he frequently did jury duty and as a man of recognized integrity he served several times as an executor of wills his wife mary branch brought him some property and when he died in he had several slaves besides his widow mary he left a son thomas and a daughter martha these three names kept reappearing in the family with unfailing regularity they were all present at monticello it would be easy to make too much of the fact that mary branch jefferson three years after she became a widow married a man who could sign the wedding contract only by making his mark for her second husband joseph mattocks had property and she herself could write her name there is no reason to

the establishment of the college of william and mary practically the only educational opportunities were those that england provided a few of the very rich the result was a generation of men who if they had the good fortune to read and write had no further commerce with the muses or learned sciences but spent their life ignobly at the hoe and spade and other employments of an uncul tivated and unpolished country not until the greatest of the name appeared did any of the jeffersons have much learning but the lack of it was too general at this time to constitute an insuperable bar to admission into the lesser gentry whether or not the first thomas jefferson should be called a yeoman is a question of definition and a matter of no real consequence the second of the name was officially a gentleman before the end of the century thomas ii owned a racing mare and racing was generally a prerogative of the gentry more significant than this is the fact that he became one of the gentlemen justices of henrico county before he was thirty and that he continued to be one for almost twenty years among his honorable associates were the second william randolph and an early francis

unquestionably limited as were those of so many others in that dispersed society he did not grow up in such ignorance as to be seriously handi capped in practical affairs but the accident of his position within the family may have caused him to be relatively neglected he lost his mother while he was still a child and as the youngest of three sons he had only modest expectations in his youth

a heavy loss from fire which occasioned him to petition the house of burgesses for relief and a few years later when he failed to contest a suit against him for pounds of tobacco the court ordered an attachment of his property sufficient to satisfy the debt the will which he drew six years before his death in and die inventory which ultimately went with it show that he had considerably more household goods livestock and servants than thomas jefferson i had had but they leave many unanswered questions about his land neither peter nor his elder brother field lived on the ancestral acres after their father died as a justice of the peace in lunenburg field maintained the connection of the family with the county gentry peter who was named his fathers executor got the holdings on fine and manikin creeks in goochland county and if he did not already live on them he soon began to his inheritance of land was probably fairsized though certainly not princely besides this he received the bulk of his fathers personal possessions including half of the livestock a couple of horses and two slaves presumably body servants to a modest extent he was a slaveowner and by birth and association he was a member of the county gentry he cannot be described as a com pletely selfmade man but the enhancement of his fortunes like the improvement of his mind must be chiefly attributed to his own exertions soon after he presented his fathers will and had it approved in the county court he removed or returned to fine creek he was then about twentyfive years old and at the peak of his great physical strength the county of goochland to which he went had recently been set off from henrico it lay above the fall line and straddled the james peters place was on a minor tributary to the south of the river here he lived some ten years until about developing his planta tion acquiring claims and titles elsewhere and gaining for himself a recognized standing in the district the date of his

and north carolina immortalized by the second william byrd peter jefferson who afterwards helped ex tend this dividing line appears to have accompanied his neighbor on some of his later trips and from him he probably acquired the elements of surveying such knowledge was immensely useful to any planter and it played an important part in peters successful career as it did in that of george washington

had the misfortune to become his own master too soon perhaps he was not sufficiently deferential to the colonel that urbane gentleman remarked that he had a strange conceit of his own sufficiency which was accentuated by a small smattering of learning william of tuckahoe was five or six years younger than peter jefferson who by all accounts was mo dest the friendship of these county neighbors may have been a case of the attraction of opposites or merely the result of propinquity in a fluid and friendly society the two young men became magistrates in the same year and their names were

isham randolph uncle of young william the eldest of the many children there was a girl named jane she was nineteen and peter jefferson was thirty two when he married her in october perhaps the courtship began a couple of years earlier for her father and william of tuckahoe had shared peters bond for one thousand pounds sterling when he became sheriff isham probably knew and trusted him even before that but he himself had not yet setded down at dungeness when peter first came to goochland ishams daughter had been born in england and he was no man of the back country he had had greater opportunities and a more colorful life than peters father isham randolph and five of his brothers attended the college of william and mary his grandson observed afterwards that in this family they

recommending him for the command of a ship by the fae of that year he was referring to isham as captain and putting tobacco aboard his vessel intimate social relations between the two men were maintained during byrds later residence in london it was probably in that captain randolph found a wife in eng land his marriage to jane daughter of charles and jane lilbume rogers took place in the

about thirteen her father was referred to as isham randolph in shakespeares walk merchant but he was known as captain for almost twenty years longer and not unte the last decade of his life did he

curious men and that he then proceed to ishams place where he would receive a warm welcome of bartrams comments on his visit to dungeness and on the botanical excursions which he centered there the following would probably have been of greatest interest to jane randolphs plantloving son there grows on the other side of james river said bartram to colonel custis a little above isham randolphs a

was to write or speak to isham he would procure thee some his description of his host to collinson as a generous goodnatured gentleman and well respected by most who are acquainted with him may sound like faint praise but at least it reveals that isham had the characteristic social virtues of his class this friendly man afterwards regretted that he could not entertain his former guest by sending

more conspicuous in the same month that hr was chosen a burgess he was appointed adjutant general of the colony and he held this office until his death four years later he was expected to go into the various counties and give instruction in the form of exercise that had been prepared for the soldiers the council which appointed him described him as a wellknown gentleman and univer sally acceptable

carthagena governor gooch took charge of these and left the colony for a year during his absence isham randolph acted as chief officer of the local militia and for this reason it has sometimes been said that he was designated as lieutenant general of the colony there were plenty of military titles in thomas jeffersons ancestral record his maternal grandfather may not have been a conspicuously martial figure but at least isham was a link in a highly honorable military tradition his successor as adjutant general was lawrence washington and when the latter died three years later the colony was divided into districts and four adjutants were appointed among these was lawrences brother george it is difficult to recover the personality of a man from his portrait or his epitaph it may be

young planter acquired no fortune by his marriage but he gained for his unborn children a far more extensive and influential family connection than he himself had enjoyed it is likely that the couple began their married life comfortably but modestly at fine creek and that their first two children were bom there four or five years before his marriage peter had staked out a claim on the rivanna below the gap in the southwest mountains the date of his earliest known grant in this remote region was june when his future wife was only fourteen he may have made his surveys before the leaves fell and he certainly received a patent for one thou sand acres before the passing of another summer his tract extended southward from secretarys ford just above the mountains and in cluded the later site of monticello and a body of bottom land below the little river within a year he began to look for a more suitable homesite than his own lands afforded his friend william randolph of tuckahoe who had probably interested him in this region in the first place had acquired lands north of the rivanna which were still un developed peter made a deal whereby he acquired two hundred acres of these in return for a bowl of arrack punch concocted by henry wetherburn of the raleigh tavern in williamsburg not until two years after his marriage however did peter round out the home tract he then acquired

the acreage to which peter had title was not extensive by virginia standards and was not immediately increased in that era of landgrabbing he received large grants elsewhere but there is no certain way of knowing how many of these he was ever able to perfect and on one occasion the allpowerful council administered a distinct rebuff by rejecting one of his petitions as unreasonable he may have over reached himself but in view of the success of others it seems more probable that despite his connection with the randolphs he lacked influence at the seat of power on the whole he was a modest specu lator in land in comparison with his mighty contemporaries in the province and even with certain of his near neighbors in the rivanna region however he had the distinction of being one of the first settlers and this was always a matter of pride to his son though unexpected events interrupted his stay peter played an impor tant part in the organization of a county which boasts many distin guished sons but has been most glorified by the name of jefferson in september because of the inconvenience attending the upper inhabitants of goochland the assembly provided that after the last day of december the existing county should be divided and a new one bearing the euphonious name of albemarle be formed peter jefferson who had been a magistrate in the old county attended the first

is said to have contained thirtyfive rooms john page the companion of thomas jeffersons youth and young manhood was her nephew she had borne william randolph two daughters and a son who was given the names of his two grandfathers thomas mann ran dolph was a couple of years older than thomas jefferson who could say afterwards that he had known him all his life after his wife died william of tuckahoe made a will wherein he named peter as one of his executors three years later foreseeing his approaching death he added a codicil in which he included the request that his dear and loving friend should move down with his own family to the tuckahoe house and remain there until randolphs son was grown in the technical sense peter jefferson was not the guardian of thomas mann randolph but the children remained at tuckahoe with the jefferson family large monetary bequests had been made to the girls and the balance of the estate was to go to the son as the resident executor peter was the custodian of the land and in the practical sense he was far more than a guardian his economic status was consider ably more modest than that of wilham randolph but in view of his standing as magistrate and friend it seems impossible that he could have been asked to assume an undignified position in general he did such things at tuckahoe as the master himself would have done had he been there doubtless doing most of them a good deal better it is surprising however that he should have been willing to leave his own lands in order to care for those of another besides being an act of

directed the activities of at least seven overseers at tuckahoe and reported the production of far more tobacco on colonel randolphs quarters than he could have expected from his own fields in albe marle his smaller holdings there were still largely forested and he probably thought it desirable to leave the task of pioneering to an overseer and his gang planters often did that before moving their families into new lands in the piedmont while at tuckahoe he could keep his eye on his fine creek property which lay near one of the randolph quarters peter jefferson kept his accounts methodically as his son did afterwards but those which remain do not reveal how much he received for his services to the estate the traditional report that he got only his living expenses is probably correct but the food and lodging of his growing family constituted a considerable item and he was unquestionably a more prosperous man after this period than he had been before though he did not stay as long as william of tuckahoe had desired he guarded the land and the heir for six or seven years altogether thus it came about that the home of thomas jeffersons earliest re membrance was a randolph

the journey from shadwell to tuckahoe the circumstances must have been specially impressive for he was only two or three years old at the time he had now ceased to be the youngest member of the family but he was still the only boy at the age of twenty months he had acquired a third sister and a fourth was born shortly after he turned three two more boys were bom at tuckahoe but one lived only a few weeks and the other did not survive a day the five young jeffersons and the three young randolphs comprised r goodsized group of children and doubtless a lively one if the house was then completed in its historic external form as seems probable they could have lived almost as two separate families thereby diminishing domestic confusion to some degree it had two distinct wings which were connected by a iarge room or salon and thus it assumed the shape of the letter h one of the wings had brick ends but otherwise it was a frame structure painted white at that time it may not have contained the fine paneling and rich stairways which were seen in it later but the rooms had high ceilings and were airy jefferson was there as a little boy and he often stopped with thomas mann randolph after he grew up but he saw no reason to describe such a familiar house in letters architecture of this sort did not impress him after he was attracted to classic columns and had family tradition as given by

stream than the rivanna always must have seemed an exceedingly pleasant place colonel jefferson was directly charged to carry out william ran dolphs ins tructions about the education of his son the heir was not to be sent to the college of william and mary or to england on any account whatever but private tutors were to be employed for his instruction thus the credible tradition arose that young tom jeffer son first studied under young tom randolphs teacher in a little house still standing in the yard this part of his education he afterwards described as the english school without giving any

fervently repeated the lords prayer in the hope of hastening a meal the implication is clear that he received conventional religious instruction but there is certainly no suggestion that there was any shortage of food in this and in other respects his father was a good provider peter jefferson was more than that he was not merely providing a comfortable home for his family while doing a service to a dead friend he was also venturing far from the tobacco fields upon occa sion and carving a reputation for himself out of the wilderness if his career is at all memorable for its own sake and not solely as a brief prologue to one that was illustrious it is because of what he did as a surveyor of boundaries and a maker of maps during the years that he had headquarters at tuckahoe this record of

photo by cook studios richmond john page as a boy portrait by wollaston the services of peter jefferson known afterwards as the fairfax line it is a pity that the boy was not old enough to hear the story of this hazardous adventure while the fathers memory of it was fresh the colonel was never much of a talker however he was a man of action between the potomac and the rappahannock lay the vast domain of lord fairfax known as the northern neck it was a part of the prov ince of virginia so far as government was concerned but tide to the soil lay with the proprietor the western limits of this princely estate were long the subject of dispute but finally by order of the privy council the boundary was drawn for seventysix miles between the headspring of the rappahannock that is the source of the conway or rapidan across mountain ranges and primeval wilderness to the head spring of the potomac which was already marked this was the fair fax line the members of the expedition who assembled below the blue ridge in september comprised some forty men and at the start they had about that many horses there were commissioners for the crown and for lord fairfax the former including joshua fry of albemarle county and there were surveyors who had been deputed by these gendemen colonel jefferson and robert brooke had been named for the crown captain benjamin winslow and thomas lewis for the proprietor it was lewis who recorded in crude but graphic language the story of the journey the journey out from the head of the con way rapidan to the headspring of the potomac where they drank the kings health and set up the fairfax stone required four weeks the trip back to the starting point where they drank healths even more lustily and set up another stone took three the preparations had been elaborate but this was no pleasure trip even for the commissioners who generally went with the baggage by the easiest route colonel jefferson and the other surveyors had to follow the direct line wherever it went though they always remained mounted as long as they could it took them over successive ranges of mountains that were prodigiously full of fallen timber and ivey up and down precipices where the horses slipped and fell and through swamps of laurel which appeared impenetrable one dreadful place they called purgatory and one stream dismal enough to strike terror in any human creature

for peter at thirty nine the expedition was a feat of endurance but the only sign of weak ness he gave was that once he was much indisposed thomas jefferson never stood on the top of the alleghanies where his father crossed nor saw the initials p j carved on a beech near the fairfax stone the information about the topography of his native region which he incorporated in his notes on virginia was gained from several sources but from his father he could have learned that the mountains are not solitary and scattered confusedly over the face of the country but are disposed in ridges one behind another he appears not to have referred in writing to his fathers connection with the fairfax line but undoubtedly he knew of peters victories over the wilderness and was heartened by them though he himself was an explorer and a pioneer of another sort on november after the senior surveyor for the crown had carved his initials on a birch tree near the head of conway he set out for home the other surveyors joined him at tuckahoe early in the new year and by the last week in february their joint labors were completed at a greater age tom would have been deeply interested in their doings the map of the northern neck that was sent to eng land was described as drawn by peter jefferson and robert brooke for the region east of the blue ridge they followed the earlier map of mayo but they incorporated enough new material about the val ley of virginia to give their own map the value of a source rec ord needless to say this map showed for the first time the fairfax line the name of joshua fry is linked with that of peter jefferson in the most important of the latters activities as a surveyor in effect if not in fact the two men constituted a partnership somewhat more than three years after they helped set up the fairfax stone they surveyed the dividing line between virginia and north carolina for ninety miles beyond the point where william byrd and his fellow commissioners

line to peters creek in the fall of colonel fry and colonel jefferson extended it to steep rock creek in what is now washington county the plan itself shows that they crossed new river and many small streams and several ranges of mountains the hardships and perils that they met must have been talked about in toms presence for they became a tradition in his family years later his grandchildren repeated stories which must have come through him that these men had to defend themselves against wild beasts by day and to sleep in the trees at night that their provi sions ran low and they had to live on raw flesh that peters courage did not fail when his companions fainted from exhaustion beside him he and fry went further than they had gone when drawing the fairfax line and both of them were now older for their extraordinary trouble and painful service however they did not go unrewarded before the end of the year they reported their proceedings to the council produced an account of their expenses and presented their maps then the members of that body unanimously agreed that each of them was deserving of three hundred pounds sterling beyond all expenses nor were their abilities forgotten some months later the acting governor following a directive from the lords of trade selected them as the best qualified persons to draw a map of the in habited part of virginia in october the honorable lewis bur well whose daughter was wooed unsuccessfully by the son of peter jefferson asked the opinion of the council in regard to their compensa tion each was thought deserving of one hundred and fifty pounds sterling for his expense and trouble their map was done by that time and unlike the original materials on which it was based it has withstood the ravages of fire and time for

he did nothing in particular in the french and indian war but he was the chief officer and the first citi zen of the county during much of this time tom was away from home at school in goochland but when the boy returned to look at the mountains and flourish in the sunshine of albemarle there could be no doubt of his established position in the community tom was about nine years old when the family moved back to shadwell not until after his fathers death five years later did he observe the full procession of the seasons in albemarle but he was here during vacations at least and henceforth this place was home it pro vided the domestic background of his life until he was twentyseven no mansion ever stood on this homesite but his father erected a sub stantial group of plantation buildings before he died he either en larged the little house in which the boy had been born or built another wooden structure for the central unit and he added a dairy smoke house and other outbuildings of the sort until he had a frontage of more than two hundred feet above the river to the southward the land sloped for several hundred yards to the rivanna where he had a water mill this occupied a good deal of his sons attention later on the three notched road passed the place on the north much as the highway does today and proceeding westward through the gap crossed the stream at the secretarys ford the ridge of the southwest mountains which is broken at this gap enters the present county in the extreme northeast and there it reaches its greatest height fifteen hundred feet in a knob which came to be called peters mountain for colonel jefferson as his son said all the virginia mountains run in the same direction from northeast to south west but these being the first discovered appropriated the latter name to themselves the range roughly parallels the blue ridge about twenty miles away on its slopes tom hunted and beneath them many of the first plantation houses nestled there may have been

the eye could command the blue ridge but settlers had been attracted first to the eastern which faced the sunrise properties ran in generous strips from the wooded summits to the lowlands the largest of these dated back to a grant of more than thirteen thousand acres to nicholas meriwether which was referred to as the grant because it was so early and so huge this included the site of castle hill some eight miles from shadwell though no planta tion house had been erected there as yet a considerable part of this lordly estate eventually came into the possession of dr thomas walker wherever he may have been living when the jeffersons came back he soon served peter as a friend and his son john afterwards became intimate with tom closer at hand was john harvie who had bought lands adjoining the william randolph property it is uncertain just when he built belmont but from an early time he was a near neigh bor as nearness was understood in albemarle the shadwell tract proper consisted of only four hundred acres but colonel jefferson soon purchased the place on the same side of the river that was later known as pantops his son always liked this because of its magnificent view south of the river peters lands stretched toward carters mountain and included not only the site of monticello but also a small tract which he had patented in and which was known as portobello to this he now added another of the same size called tufton he also patented a body of woodland which is identified on thomas jeffersons land roll as pounceys approximately two thou sand six hundred and fifty acres that the latter afterwards held in this part of the county were acquired by his father peter jefferson was also increasing his holdings and developing his lands in another part of albemarle three more children joined the family after the removal from tuckahoe including the twins one of whom was a boy named randolph peter built up for his sons two estates of practically the same size one centering at shadwell and the other on tike south fork of the james sometimes called the fluvanna soon after the county was formed the assembly had empowered him joshua fry and others to expend one hundred pounds in clearing the latter stream of rocks which in several places obstructed naviga tion it was broader than the north branch or rivanna and unlike it served an important function in starting the money crop on the way to market mffiile the jeffersons were still at tuckahoe there had been natalie j disbrow thomas walker of albemarle in papers of albemarle historical society i charlottesville with abundant references see appendix n a and b february hening v the services of peter jefferson a notable advance in the use of canoes above the fall line this was owing to the ingenuity of the reverend robert rose a large planter who lashed two of these tottering vehicles together and thus enabled them to carry eight or nine hogsheads of tobacco at a time without tipping peter s tobacco from the rivanna district had to go by land either by wagon or by the crude method of rolling in specially con structed hogsheads but he was able to employ water transportation on the fluvanna his main place there he named snowden after the mountain in wales near the reputed home of his ancestors in his life time the fluvanna district was the more important part of the county the courthouse was there near the present town of scottsville he was one of the persons who had determined the location and he owned houses at the ferry crossing which he leased to the keeper of an ordi nary this was about twentyfive miles from shadwell not until the region below the fluvanna had been separated from albemarle after thomas jefferson went to college was the town of charlottesville established by law and the courthouse located there it was built on its present site about four miles west of shadwell this was too late to do peter jefferson any good but it was a convenience to his son as a practising lawyer even during the revolution the county seat contained little besides a courthouse a tavern and a dozen houses a traveler then observed that the region when viewed from one of its many eminences appeared as a vast forest interspersed with plantations four or five miles apart and resembling small villages this was no land of bustling towns nor predominantly of small farms as a rule holdings were larger than in the shenandoah valley though smaller than in tidewater when peter jefferson knew the region and his son was a boy this was a silent country of farflung patriarchal seats though these were without architectural pretension afterwards plain farm houses on smaller clearings increased in number in the bottoms and on the lower slopes the red soil was rich in its virginal state

favorable to virginias historic crop and also to the fruit trees and grains which peter jeffersons son after wards encouraged while the dogwood the redbud and the shadbush made this a sylvan paradise in spring by all prevailing standards the district was healthful the inhabitants often spoke of themselves as mountaineers and congratulated themselves on their freedom from agues and fevers before thomas jefferson was grown one of them said the descent of our lands is so quick that morasses are scarcely known among us and the rapidity of our waters so great that none of them has leisure to stagnate but the very rapidity of these waters increased the difficulties of transportation which more than any other single factor distinguished the piedmont from the region of the lower james the large planters had slaves to perform the cruder tasks of pioneering and they brought with them the agricultural economy and the social traditions of tidewater but in this isolated region they could not reproduce precisely the life of westover or turkey island or even of tuckahoe styles were simpler here selfsufficiency was more imperative and one might expect an even more notable spirit of personal independence to be engendered for years after peter jefferson became a magistrate wolf bounties were listed at sessions of the county court seventy pounds of tobacco for a young wolf and twice that much for an old one there were no indians here when the first settlers came and during the french and indian war this was not among the frontier counties but in the tier just before them fears of raids were voiced at that time but this had ceased to be a frontier region in the precise sense despite its vast body of uncleared lands it had an ordered if dispersed society neverthe less residents of albemarle remembered that joshua fry and peter jefferson had penetrated uncharted country and men associated with the county followed their example thomas walker of castle hill carried on the dividing line from the point where they had left it and george rogers clark who yas bom across the southwest mountains from shadwell just about the time that peter returned conquered the northwest during the revolution his younger and equally redheaded brother william clark was bom in another county after his family had this one but meriwether lewis whose name is linked with his in the history of exploration was a native under the direction of presi dent jefferson they crossed a continent the tradition of the wilderness persisted in albemarle james maury june in memoirs of a huguenot family p many references to the healthfulness of the region can be found in jeffersons own writings the services of peter jefferson in this congenial locality peter jefferson kept on surveying lands and developing his farms until his great strength began to fail despite his reputed ability to head up two hogsheads of tobacco at the same time he died when he was still less than fifty his elder son then lanky at fourteen was never to be quite that strong but was destined to live much longer perhaps the sire had given too freely of a strength that had seemed so abundant perhaps he had exposed himself to too many hardships or it may be that the unknown malady which assailed him in the summer of could have been cured at a later stage in the progress of medicine there were only two physicians in the county at the time and their practice was incidental dr walker who attended him is best known to history as an explorer and landspeculator his professional visits to his friend were numerous and his services were as skillful as could have been expected they were unavailing how ever for the patient died on august he had become a man of substantial property though it would be an exaggeration to call him a land baron the rivanna and fluvanna tracts together comprised not far from five thousand acres and he had at least half that many more chiefly in the county as then constituted he also had certain speculative claims including an interest in the loyal land company with dr walker and others for his time he was not much of a speculator however and his son was never one at all the list of his slaves is impressive he had more than sixty of them along with twentyfive horses seventy head of cattle and two hundred hogs these and other material details were revealed by the inventory of his considerable estate and the will which he drew a few months before he died discloses the careful provisions he made for the future welfare of his wife his two sons and his six daughters he prescribed an eminently fair distribution he provided for his wife by leaving her for her lifetime the house and plantation at shad well together with a sufficient portion of the slaves stock and horses he left to each of his children a body servant and to each of his daughters a carefully safeguarded portion of two hundred pounds to be paid within a year of her marriage or twentyfirst birthday he fully maintained the standard of isham randolph and he was deter mined that future husbands should not be kept waiting he did not the family traditions are given by randall i archibald henderson in proceedings american antiquarian society ns xli see appendix ii a will dated july proved oct it and the inventory are in will book no albemarle county pp copies at uva jefferson the virginian weigh the scales heavily in favor of the elder son and none of the property was entailed that son did not forget the lesson when he became twentyone thomas was to have either the lands on the rivanna or the fluvanna as he should choose along with a proper share of the livestock half of the slaves not otherwise disposed of and the residue of the estate the lands that he did not choose were to go ultimately to his brother randolph along with a similar portion of the slaves and stock as the residuary legatee he got the larger share but the distribution of property between him and his young brother was certainly far more equitable than the distribution of talents thomas also got his fathers books mathematical instruments cherrytree desk and bookcase and his designated servant the mulatto fellow sawney was the most valuable slave the estate was a going concern during the remaining years of his minority and provided for the family comfortably john harvie was the working executor there were fewer overseers than there had been at tuckahoe generally there were three and the tobacco crop was only about half of what had come from colonel randolphs quarters though much com was raised and sold food fuel and some clothing came from the place and the actual monetary requirements were slight by any modem standard even after his death peter jefferson con tinued to be a good provider he had selected men of substance as his executors young thomas jefferson consulted john harvie and colonel peter randolph occasionally and he maintained affectionate relations with thomas turpin who was his uncle by marriage but the one with whom he had most to do in later years was thomas walker not until he was grown could thomas jefferson do anything about the land and the slaves his father left him it is uncertain just when he began to use the mathematical instruments that he inherited but he was interested in surveying throughout his maturity in spirit at least he could follow the trail across untrodden mountains and as a draftsman drawing plats and house plans he was also his fathers son he probably used the cherrytree desk in posting early accounts as he had so often seen the colonel do one reason for leaving him the bookcase was that he had gone to it very frequently already the forty volumes he is known to have inherited constituted an insignificant library in the light of his mature standards but they formed the nucleus of his first collection for details about the executors and latex operations see appendix n a the services of peter jefferson one can assume nothing in particular about the first master of shad well from the inventory list bible and prayer book were there as in almost every planters library along with books useful to a magistrate there were several volumes of addison and of english history a work in astronomy some books of a geographical nature and six or eight maps thomas jeffersons statement in old age about his fathers neg lected education must be coupled with the further comment that he had strong native intelligence and improved himself this is certainly not to say however that this practical and mathematical man ever be came an inveterate reader there were reputable planters who had fewer books than he but he did not have many his major acquisitions were of another sort and his achievements were out of doors upon the face of the record his chief legacy to thomas was an established position in society and the means to maintain it but for that alone he would never have been honored in his sons memory as he was thomas jefferson did not set that much store on inherited privilege he may have imbibed certain democratic attitudes from his father for the colonel had associated with crude men on the frontier and in the wilderness and the tradition is that he understood and valued them this surveyor of boundaries may have been critical of the group within which he had established himself more firmly than any of his ancestors had done his son in thoughtful maturity was not at all displeased by memories of his indifference to social trappings but peter jefferson exemplified the qualities of the ruling group which were really vital from his career his heir might have observed that the aristocracy of virginia had not yet grown old that it was still close to the soil from which it sprang that it continued to maintain a high sense of public responsibility this strong and vigorous man may have been deficient in the refinements but he embodied the fundamental qualities which enabled this society to endure for all his lack of book learning he deeply appreciated it and it was he more than anyone else who caused his son to be well schooled the tradition is that his dying instruction was that the boy should receive a thorough classical education and thomas himself said that he was more grateful for this than for all the other privileges which his fathers care had placed within his reach if he had to choose between his estate and a liberal education he would have taken the latter but no choice was necessary for he was given both reproduced in va mag x the works of shakespeare were not in cluded despite the tradition randall i to joseph priestley jan l b x schooldays in albemarle t om had no masculine companionship within the family after the death of his father he had been separated from the colonel much of the time during the past five years and he said relatively little about aim afterwards but undoubtedly he missed him late in life he said that from the age of fourteen his whole care and direction were thrown on himself since he had no relative or friend who was qualified to advise or guide him this was an overstatement the loss of his father created a chasm in his life which remained unfilled until his years in williamsburg when he found mature counselors whom he honored unreservedly but in the meantime he consulted the executors occa sionally and he probably did not intend to reflect upon them or upon his mother he said much less about jane randolph jefferson however than about his father he acknowledged that she had an ancient pedigree probably regarding this as a more important fact in his early manhood than he did later on various entries in his financial records after he became a man reveal his solicitude for her welfare and his almost com plete failure to mention her name elsewhere may be attributed to his characteristic reticence about the women of his family nevertheless the only remark he is known to have made about her influence was negative and he probably did not value her counsel very highly at no time in his life did he turn to women for serious advice anyway she may have remembered and sometimes mentioned to him the parish in london for which their place had been named perhaps she talked occa sionally of her fathers friends william byrd and peter collinson thus serving to link her son with the worlds of polite learning and scientific to t j randolph nov ford ix autobiography ford i jefferson the virginian curiosity as a man of science and learning however he gained his chief inspiration elsewhere he must have inherited some of his diverse talent from his mother but there is no positive testimony about her personality and she remains a shadowy figure the family tradition was that she was affectionate cheerful humor ous and a ready writer it has also been supposed that she was of more delicate mold than her husband but almost the only thing about her that we can be sure of is that she had physical endurance beyond the average she suffered inevitable hardships in connection with succes sive moves she bore ten children altogether and brought up eight of them and she survived her husband he was considerably older than she but in those days of incessant childbearing women were often worn out a great deal sooner she was thirtyseven when peter died and she lived nineteen years more remaining a widow longer than she had been a wife her death happened to occur in the year that her elder son wrote the declaration of independence and the youngest of her children the twins attained their majority but she did not live quite long enough to rejoice in either of these events because of the death of two infant boys at tuckahoe daughters predominated in the household and there was a distinct gap between the five older children and the three younger who were bom after the return to shadwell of the younger group lucy was less than five when her father died and anna scott and randolph were under two in his teens tom probably had little to do with these babies and he never found real congeniality with randolph the five older children jane mary thomas elizabeth and martha were bom within a period of six years and it is no wonder that their mother did not do so well there after in this group there was one case of obvious inequality whether she exhausted herself in bearing thomas or there was some mishap in the next delivery the child she bore just after him was subnormal the later story of this unfortunate girl can wait but at least it can be said here that elizabeth jefferson afforded little companionship to her wellendowed brother less than three years after her fathers death the second daughter mary married and left home the dowry of two hundred pounds being duly paid to john bolling in a history of his family printed a century later it is said that he was six feet high and very large and that he cared little for the ladies until he saw his lady says this quaint record after many sighs c he married miss jefferson daughter of that jefferson who with mr fry made a map of virginia a footnote randall i for detailed information see appendix i c schooldays in albemarle adds that she was a sister of the late president of the united states at the time of his marriage john bolling was living in goochland which he afterwards represented in the house of burgesses and served as sheriff he had a place called fairfield where his young brotherin law appears to have stopped on his way to and from williamsburg in student days the roof was leaky and the young visitor was plagued with rats but john bolling was of the gentry and ultimately was called colonel after he had moved to chesterfield mary jefferson had married well and bore children profusely like her mother she had ten thomass sisters jane and martha meant more than the others in his life jane nearly three years older than he was his first favorite perhaps it was she who first showed him the virginia bluebells in the lowlands along the rivanna and who wandered with him through the woods when the wild violets were open it is said that she more than any other member of the family stimulated his boyish ambitions and en couraged him in his reading and his cultivation of music he told his grandchildren of psalm tunes she used to sing to him by that time he was remembering scenes long past for he was only twentytwo when she died unmarried and he wrote for her a latin epitaph in the little building in the yard at tuckahoe the older jefferson girls probably shared their brothers early schooling when the family returned to shadwell however there was a separation for tom was either left behind in goochland or was sent back soon thereafter in when he was nine his father placed him in the latin school of the reverend william douglas minister of st james parish northam he boarded at the clergymans house during the school term and re mained under his instruction until

hall objected to the scottish accent in a tutor james madison jokingly remarked that the scot tish french he learned from robertson proved an embarrassment thomas jefferson started out with the same sort of french and may have had the same thought when he first went to paris but his surviv ing comments relate to latin and greek which were his major subjects in his mature opinion douglas knew little of the one and less of the other much nearer home a competent classicist was awaiting him and he probably became aware of the limitations of the reverend william douglas after he had begun to

fredericksville parish which now included the part of albemarle lying north and west of the rivanna maury re garded it as the most extensive and inconvenient parish in the colony that was regularly served even after he established himself strategically on a pleasant plantation beneath the southwest mountains a couple of miles from his wifes uncle dr thomas walker he spoke of himself as leading a

dabney carr the younger james maury pointed out many years later the place designated for a race between tom jeffersons slow pony and dabney carrs swift horse tom had suggested that this should occur on february and not until the last day of the month did the others discover that they had been taken in this early jeffersonian hoax produced no lasting ill will however the disappointed rider of the swift horse was for a dozen years the closest friend that the owner of the slow pony had the fifth member of the class was probably john walker and james madison afterwards president of the college of william and mary and the first episcopal bishop of virginia came to maurys before long their teacher once described these two as being in good order and well conditioned like so many hogsheads of tobacco the school was a small but important fount of friendship for a score of years thomas jefferson was intimate with his county neighbor john walker and though the future bishop of virginia was six years younger than he and may not have been actually a classmate they had maurys school in common and always liked each other the teacher of these boys had been brought to virginia by his huguenot parents an intelligent and deeply religious couple in due course james maury had attended the college of william and mary had served there briefly as an usher in the grammar school had gone to england for holy orders and had come to fredericksville parish after a rectorship elsewhere he was to be unfortunate in many ways but clearly he was no ordinary schoolmaster his greatest pupil attested to the

observant man who wrote with vigor generally with vividness at times and too often with prolixity by the time that thomas jefferson began to attend his school maury was in bad health worn down by his labors burdened with the care of his large and growing family he was already a harassed if not an unhappy man for boarding and teaching a young gentleman he received twenty pounds a year in and when john harvie paid him on behalf of the jefferson estate a decade later when the price of food had risen and his own children had increased in number he concluded that this was small compensation for the additional expense to his table the extraordinary trouble to his family and his own labor and fatigue from this toilsome business accordingly he then increased his charge to twentylive pounds over the protests of certain patrons some of the planters in his opinion set a higher value on instruction in dancing than on the intellectual and spiritual services that he performed he had no complaints against the jeffersons how ever and he was not so embittered when thomas went to school he had not yet participated unsuccessfully in the parsons cause during the boys first year in the log schoolhouse the assembly passed what was called the two penny act and against this he heard his teacher inveigh in the household like an earlier act which maury had accepted as a temporary necessity it provided that the clergy and certain public officials be paid not in tobacco but in money at a speci fied rate owing to the shortness of the crop this rate was considerably below the market price of the season and the clergy could anticipate a loss the second act they opposed on legal grounds which seemed unassailable and upon one important occasion maury was their stand ardbearer supported by an order in council he brought suit against his vestry for the balance that appeared to be due him and but for patrick henry he might have been successful the hanover county court had no choice but to rule in his favor but the jury under henrys spell awarded him damages of only one penny this historic controversy culminated after jefferson had left maurys and he did not remember much about it

overruled by the supreme british authorities on the other hand he appeared to be opposing the general interest and the judgment of the assembly in his own behalf and in the interest of his class later issues were thus foreshadowed and on these jefferson was to take a stand against the clergy it is obvious that he did not get from maury his ideas about the relations between church and state nor did the future advocate of religious freedom get from this teacher any germinal ideas about the just treatment of dissenters the boy must have observed that the rector of fredericksville was bitterly intolerant maury was often critical of the british government but jefferson unlike his friend john page never regarded his tutor as the fountainhead of his whig gish principles from his first notable teacher jefferson gained none of his charac teristic political principles or religious ideas he was indebted to him however more than to any other man for his training in the classics after two years in this school he was able to read greek and roman authors in the original and this he continued to do throughout his long life gratefully and properly he recognized his inadequately educated father as the first cause but he also said that the acquisition of ancient languages should be the occupation of only the early years the deep and lasting impressions on his own memory must have come from days at maurys school years later he told john adams that the idea occurred to him in early life that the best clues to the proper pronunciation of the ancient languages were to be obtained from modem greeks and italians there is no authority for crediting this idea to maury and it is known that jefferson became acquainted with italians shortly before the revo lution as for greek which he regarded as the most perfect language the pursuance of his idea had to be left until he went to paris this lifelong student had a natural linguistic gift and he found teachers maurys intolerance was clearly

house below the southwest mountains he received at an impressionable age personal instruction from a sound scholar who was aware of the niceties of language and the beauties of literature however rigid james maury may have been as a churchman his enthusiasm for the classics was discriminating just as that of his most famous pupil was he could hardly have doubted the indispensability of classical training for such a pupil as thomas jefferson who was clearly marked for a profession and the exalted spheres of life but he seriously questioned its utility for most of the sons of the gentry who had tried him no little and whose customary life he had carefully observed very few of them prosecuted their studies as long as their twentieth year he said they commonly married very young and were soon encumbered with families they had to give constant attention to the management of their large estates regardless of inherited fortune it could not be expected therefore that they would have the necessary leisure and repose for a pleasurable or successful engagement in such parts of literature as the languages criticism and curious and deep re searches into antiquity this was no prophecy of jeffersons career but maury probably encouraged him to delve into modem literature as well as ancient in the spirit of the enlightenment and he probably made a distinctive contribution to the boys education in his emphasis on the mother tongue the minister described english as a language as copious and nervous as significant and expressive as numerous and musical nay to my own ears as enchanting as any that was ever spoken by any of the different families of the earth for his time and place he had a large library and he must sometimes have given his pupil advice similar to that he

and to dwell on any remarkable beauties of diction justness or sublimity of sentiment or masterly strokes of true wit which may occur in the course of your reading jeffersons emphasis was to be more

ding as soon as his younger kinsman john randolph of roanoke who is said to have been foaled not born but his father doubtless started him early thomas regarded george washington as the best horseman of the age but he himself was described in later life as an uncommonly fine rider and the family remembered him as a fearless one in a country without large setdements and where plantation seats were far apart riding was not a matter of occasional diversion but of daily necessity and good horsemanship was taken for granted among the gentry over the red roads of albemarle which wandered so capriciously through the growing trees and the fallen timber tom took many a ride not for purposes of health as in his later life but simply to go from one place to another however he was not one of those virginians described by revolutionary travelers who would go five miles to catch a horse in order to ride one mile afterwards on the contrary he came to believe that the taming of the horse had re sulted in the degeneracy of the human body and he commended walking for exercise from the time that he began to advise the young he must have begun his walking early tramping through the woods and hunting the family preserved a story about his first adventures as a huntsman when he was ten he was given a gun by his father and sent into the forest alone in order to develop selfreliance the inex perienced boy was wholly unsuccessful at first in his quest of quarry but at length he found a wild turkey caught in a pen tied it to a tree with his garter shot it and brought it home in triumph this may have been at tuckahoe but boyish hunting was in the albemarle tradition his grandson who claims never to have worn hat or shoe until he was ten used to arise at dawn and tramp barefoot through the snow in quest of wild turkeys and long years after jefferson himself shot his first bird he reported with obvious approval an in stance of even greater intrepidity he had this to say of meriwether

and opossum which seeking their food m the mght can then only be taken in this exercise no season or circumstance could obstruct his purpose plunging through the winters snows and frozen streams in pursuit of his object he himself may not have showed such zeal as this at any age but from his youth he was familiar with the habits of the coons and possums observation of plants and animals rather than stalking prey was characteristic of him in his maturity and though he continued to recommend hunting as an admirable form of youthful exercise and appears to have engaged in it himself to some degree there is no re liable evidence that he was an ardent sportsman his father bad started him in the school of selfreliance but when he first began to think he may have concluded that nature should be explored and not exploited accomplishments were expected of him as a young gentleman dancing which was proverbially popular was little short of a social necessity virginians are of genuine blood said philip fithian they will dance or die during his second year at maurys his fathers executor john harvie made a payment to mr inglis for teaching children mo to dance this instruction tom shared with four of his sisters we do not know whether or not the dancing class went from house to house as in westmoreland thus permitting a better balance of the sexes but before he entered the raleigh tavern he was probably familiar with the minuets reels and country dances which were so often mentioned by the prerevolutionary diarists two years before the declaration of independence one of these said any young gentleman travelling through the colony is presumed to be acquainted with dancing boxing playing the fiddle and small sword and cards somewhat less may have been required in the sixties but young thomas jefferson had another of these accomplish ments besides dancing before he went aw t ay to college it is said that while he was still at maurys his favorite indoor amusement was

mans political ear afterwards became sensitive jefferson knew the country fiddle tunes which were played at balls as well as at countless infor mal rustic gatherings and he copied them in his music books also at some time he wrote in a copy of daniel purcells psalms set full for the organ or harpsichord the words of the new version from the metrical translations of tate and brady which were gradually superseding the older psalter these were the tunes presumably that his sister jane sang so often and that he played with her he always preferred them to hymns and they always recalled her presence what thomas looked like as he neared seventeen we can only con jecture from the descriptions given of him long afterwards when observations seemed to be worth recording he had large hands and feet and by this time must have grown tall he towered well over six feet eventually and was very strong even though never quite up to his fathers standard his movements are said to have been rather awk ward his hair was reddish in youth and he freckled quickly his eyes were hazel though often described in later years as blue and judging by how long he kept them his teeth must have been magnificent he had good health throughout most of his life along with comparable vitality nobody ever claimed that he was handsome but it was often said after wards that he looked benevolent and he always prized the quality of good nature he was thinskinned however and for many years had to overcome his native shyness he may have been rather indifferent to clothes during his rustic period as he

ascended the english throne unaware that in the village capital of the royal province of virginia there was a stripling who would one day de nounce him in immortal language up to this time so far as we know the future author of the declara tion of independence had written nothing suggesting the cadences of that historic document or anticipating his later grace but he had drafted one letter which has survived this was an eager but stilted note to john harvie proposing that he leave the mountains for the college after talking things over with another executor colonel peter randolph he had soberly marshaled his arguments to justify an important step he could continue his study of the classics at the college he believed he could learn something of mathematics and he could gain a more universal acquaintance there if these reasons were insufficient others could have been easily adduced having outgrown maurys this promising boy deserved other opportunities and it seemed highly unlikely that he would waste them he himself remarked that the coming of company was causing him to lose a fourth of his time jan ford i jefferson the virginian at home he was already impatient with encroachment on his precious hours and any hindrance to his pursuit of knowledge after a while he talked a good deal about going to england but this possibility seems not to have been considered seriously at first if it ever was his advisers were doubtless aware that there was confusion in the college this was to continue until the revolution and to cause some of the gentry to question the propriety of sending their sons there for moral improvement and the acquisition of sound learning on the other hand there were those who said that education was a good deal worse in england and with them the mature jefferson would have heartily agreed several virginians among them robert carter of nomini hall who afterwards fully redeemed himself had returned so inconceivably illiterate and also corrupted and vicious that mann page of rosewell swore that no son of his should go to school in england accordingly this wealthy planter sent his son john to the grammar school of william and mary at the age of thirteen and put him to lodge and board with president thomas dawson who was also commissary of the bishop of london and minister of bruton church peter jeffersons son who entered at a higher level as he was nearing seventeen likewise escaped foreign contamination though he gained no high impression of the learning and morals of the clergymen on the faculty during his student days in williamsburg lodging and eating in the college were not compulsory for paying scholars but the surviving records imply that he did not avail himself of the privilege of living in town he began to pay board on march and continued to do so for two years and one month then so far as the records show his college career was over about this time the faculty were forced to enjoin the housekeeper to serve both fresh and salt meat for dinner to provide puddings and pies on sunday and two weekdays and to see that the suppers were not made up of differ ent sorts of scraps but were the same for every

described the col lege and the hospital in williamsburg as rude misshapen piles which but that they have roofs would be taken for brickkilns this however was after he had fallen under the spell of palladio his archi tectural judgment could hardly have been that severe when he was a youth fresh from the frame buildings of albemarle at a later time he also condemned the educational organization of the college and tried to improve it the statutes had been revised a couple of years before he entered but in framework the college was essentially unchanged from until he became governor of virginia half a century later it consisted of the grammar school which was preparatory the indian school which a few redskins still attended the philosophy school in which he himself was enrolled and the divinity school which he after wards helped to abolish two professors were assigned to each of the two latter and each of the former had a single master with the presi dent the entire faculty consisted of seven men and there were prob ably not more than a hundred scholars and students altogether with the single but important exception of william small professor of natural philosophy the members of the william and mary faculty were anglican clergymen and for half a dozen years they had been embroiled in controversy with the local political authorities two years before jefferson enrolled there had been an upheaval and it was as a result of this that small had come to the college because of their activities against the two penny act which as we have seen affected the pay of the clergy unfavorably three of the professors had been dismissed by the local governing body the board of visitors one of these men died but the two others appealed to england for reinstate ment and

logic and ethics in the august of jeffersons first year which had begun in late march and was interrupted by no long summer vacation rowe and the master of the grammar school became far too merry and led the college boys in a row with the boys of the town consequently one of these clergymen was summarily dismissed and the other resigned the immediate results were favorable to jefferson almost a year passed before a successor to the deposed professor of moral philosophy was installed and in the interim small added all or many of rowes subjects to his own he was already giving jefferson his first views of the expansion of science and according to this eminent pupil he gave the first lectures ever delivered in the college in ethics rhetoric and belleslettres either these subjects had been previously sacrificed to logic or they had been taught more mechanically by men who lacked smalls happy talent of communication for nearly half of jeffersons course small appears to have been the only regular teacher that he had whatever may be thought about the organization ad ministration and discipline of the college here was one of those rare personal influences which prove unforgettable and elicit immortal tribute he afterwards said that small probably fixed the destinies of his life but for small the first year must have been deeply disillusioning to him in the midst of all the woes created by convivial and riotous members of the faculty president dawson himself began to drink notoriously and when arraigned before the board of visitors on the charge of habitual drunkenness confessed the fact his friend lieu tenant governor fauquier defended him saying that he had been teased by contrariety of opinions between him and the clergy into the loss of his spirits and it was no wonder that he should apply for con solation to spirituous liquors he was granted a pardon on the promise of future sobriety but the unfortunate man became quite irre sponsible he died in december not until spring did the reverend william yates from whose arid teaching john page had suffered else where qualify as his successor he also became minister of bruton church which jefferson attended

have made a deep impression on so sensitive a mind but at this immature age he was not deeply interested in the continuing struggle between the clerical faculty and the local governing board the fundamental question was whether the bishop of london or the gentlemen of virginia should have final authority over the college and the church and the gentry would have given the same answer to this if thomas jefferson had never gone to school in williamsburg his later distinction among his fellows was owing to his championship not merely of local selfgovernment but of complete religious liberty the seeds of anticlericalism however were probably sown in his mind while he was in college or soon afterwards when he became intimate with francis fauquier he could hardly have failed to learn that the relations between the brilliant governor and the local representatives of english ecclesiasticism were far from amicable and on personal grounds his sympathies may have been enlisted against the clergy it is a highly significant fact also that the early teacher who did most to fix the destinies of his life was the only layman in the faculty of the college the surviving record of this influential layman is all too brief he was a scotchman designated as mr william small when he was appointed in he remained in williamsburg six years returned to england where he is said to have been the friend of james watt and erasmus darwin and died at birmingham in listed as william small md he had assumed the title after he left virginia the cir cumstances of his going were unpleasant his predecessor as professor of natural philosophy was successful in his appeal to england and had to be restored small had been sent over by the bishop of london in the first place but he had less reason than his clerical colleagues to rely on english ecclesiastical authority and during his stay in the colony he was on more friendly terms than the others with the local political group it was a sign of the approval of the board of visitors that they proceeded to elect him to the chair of moral philosophy which was again vacant after he had lost the professorship of natural philosophy at the same time however the board passed a statute affirming the j e kirkpatrick constitutional development of the college of william and mary tv m ser vi perry hist colls i besides references to faculty

dependable source is a letter from stephen to edward hawtrey mar w m coll papers folder this is based on a conversation with small jefferson the virginian right to remove any member of the faculty at will small balked at agreeing to that went to england to look into the matter further and declined to return there were some other matters of disagreement and in the end he aroused the strong displeasure of the presiding officer of the board who wrote him a sarcastic letter at some time jefferson probably learned about all this and he may have reflected that local authority itself is likely to become tyrannical what he learned from his favorite teacher was not obedience to authority but delight in the exercise of his mind john page in the last year of his own life referred to this same teacher as illustrious and credited to him the beginnings of his own abiding interest in all branches of mathematics shortly after small left the college jefferson was probably thinking of him when he de scribed the study of mathematics and natural philosophy as peculiarly engaging and delightful he certainly was when he took up mathe matics again long afterwards in order to guide his grandsons course and endeavored to rub off the dust of fifty years it was always his favorite subject he said we have no theories there no uncertainties remain on the mind all is demonstration and satisfaction i have for gotten much and recover it with more difficulty than when in the vigor of my mind i originally acquired it but as he soon wrote to another thanks to the good foundation laid at college by my old master and friend small i am doing it with a delight and success beyond my ex pectation jefferson observed that small pursued an even and dignified line of conduct like others whom he particularly emulated in those cru cial days this layman was not one to be involved in student brawls on the other hand in an era of disorder he alone of the faculty denied the arbitrary power of a master to inflict punishment on an offending scholar john page called him his ever to be beloved professor and jefferson said that he gave to his studies enlightened and affectionate guidance and was like a father to him actually this unmar ried teacher whose chief complaint about his position was its loneliness made a daily companion of young jefferson and taught him no less through informal talk

his own cellar and he promised to dispatch that many more as soon as possible by another ship he did not know that his old teacher was in the last year of life there is some testimony that smalls influence persisted in the college it has been said that he more than any other teacher was responsible for the liberality of spirit which came to characterize wil liam and mary some people called it skepticism and thought it dangerous but jefferson and his kindred spirits regarded it as the first step towards true knowledge historically william small was a minor torchbearer of the enlightenment and by any reckoning he was one of those rare men who point the way who show new paths who open doors before the mind to jefferson he also opened the door of george wythes law office and he and wythe ushered this inquiring young man into the gov ernors palace thus were the benefits of enlightened conversation in creased rather than diminished after jefferson left the college he was as intimate with small for two more years as one of his age could be his life and associations in williamsburg before he was admitted to the bar cannot be divided into sharply defined segments but if his college course can be described separately it is best summed up by saying that he continued to be taught privately and that his tutor was william small the same sort of statement can be made about the five years after that when he studied law under george wythe he gained clear title to fame in later years as a prophet and architect of public educa tion but his own training was preeminently personal and private selfimposed rather than external discipline shaped his education from his youth onward in his last decade he wrote i was a hard student until i entered on the business of life the duties of which leave no idle time to those disposed to fulfill them and now retired and at the age of seventysix i am again a hard student the first period of his amazing life differed in many ways from the important and exacting era of public service which followed but the habit of to small may lc partly printed in ford i a coles to henry st george tucker july cfv m ser iv to dr vine utley mar ford x jefferson the virginian study persisted drafting state papers brought him no such joy as the free pursuit of knowledge and he could not approach all public prob lems with the zeal of the explorer but in all his tasks he could and did manifest the seriousness and the industry of the scholar his characteristic habits of study may have been formed even before he went to williamsburg said one of his young admirers who observed him when he was ripe in years and honors his mind must have been by nature one of uncommon capa ciousness and retention of wonderful clearness and as rapid as is consistent with accurate thoughts his application from very early youth has not only been intense but unremitted when young he adopted a system perhaps an entire plan of life from which neither the exigencies of business nor the allurements of pleasure could drive or seduce him much of his success is to be ascribed to methodical industry even when at school he used to be seen with his greek grammar in his hand while his comrades were enjoying relaxation in the interval of school hours the family tradition is that during his college days he studied fifteen hours of twentyfour and habitually until long past midnight only to rise at dawn this sounds like too severe a program even for him in vacations he is said to have devoted almost three fourths of his tim e to his books next only to tyranny he hated indolence which he regarded as the besetting sin of his hospitable virginia countrymen and about which he wrote with appalling frequency to his children in later years it is while we are young that the habit of industry is formed he reflected if not then it never is afterwards if this is true he him self formed the habit early determine never to be idle he admon ished his growing daughter no person will have occasion to com plain of the want of time who never loses any then he made an observation which aptly sums up his own intellectual history it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing buch a regimen and such a philosophy would impose a strain on any v s n ge f p h y sk l ue he learned to guard his unusual natural gifts by physical regularity and systematic exercise though we cannot be sure justwhen he became so wise he ran and walked when in col hs ndson can be accepted he once swam thirteen tunes across a millpond that was a quarter of a mile as davk k dav s fran s walker gilmer hereafter cited rss l cou f y f the author and e dietz press martha were written in th e lexers to his daughter at the college wide this seems too much for a boy fresh from the little rivanna but the physical endurance of peter jeffersons heir was remarkable in his youth and prime it was probably in williamsburg that he estab lished the habit of bathing his feet in cold water every morning this practice he continued for upwards of sixty years and to it he attributed his lifelong freedom from colds at seventysix he reported that only two or three times in his life had he had a fever of more than twenty four hours and he then could boast that he had been blessed with organs of digestion which accept and concoct without ever murmur ing whatever the palate chooses to consign to them and that he had not lost a tooth by age the severe perfection of this portrait is somewhat relieved by his own statement that during his early years in williamsburg he was extravagant by occasional remarks of his about youthful temptations and by other indications of gaiety and frivolity the most frivolous period probably coincided with the first years that he studied law when he grumbled about his law books and indulged in much silly chatter about the girls he participated in the annual battles between town and gown but there is no suggestion that he was ever disciplined for his part in student scrapes as was his friend john walker who was rusticated in the fall of along with a couple of other boys who afterwards gained considerable renown he had left the college then and was living in town but he reported the episode with some zest he was a member of a student organization known as the flat hat club which is notable for its primacy as a secret college society but wholly lacked seriousness of purpose it is not to be confused with phi beta kappa of which jefferson knew nothing it was primarily con vivial and its certificates of membership were couched in humorous latin phraseology one of its expressed desires was that each member should be a great ornament and pillar of things general and particu lar john walker was a fellow member and the fact that there were only six altogether may or may not imply that jefferson was num bered among the socially elite he continued to attend meetings after he left college and wrote about one of them in frivolous

john page said that jefferson could tear himself away from his dearest friends to fly to his studies it seems likely that he did not cultivate the fine art of friendship consciously and assiduously until after he became somewhat discouraged about the girls but there is no reason to suppose that he flouted the dominant tradition of so ciability or that he failed to avail himself of the great opportunities for friendship which this small academic community afforded some of his most enduring associations started there one of the distinguishing characteristics of colonial williamsburg was the seasonal occasion for friendly intercourse which it offered to residents of isolated plantations in the midst of this sociable village which teemed periodically the college was set its junior members were drawn from the sons of the gentry and these constituted a closeknit group there were gradations of rank among them with the families of the councillors at the top of the social scale but there was no such invidious distinction here as john adams found at har vard college where seats in class were assigned according to parental rank or standing the son of a rugged squire from the piedmont did not have to take a lower place than john page of rosewell with this particular scion of a highly influential family jefferson was intimate from the start and through him became friends with the equally aristocratic nelsons his old schoolmate at maurys dabney carr may not have entered until the year after he did with this single exception page was jef fersons closest college friend the two were almost exactly the same age and they were to be like brothers for almost half a century page had the more impressive economic and social background through his grandmother he was a descendant of king carter and his grand father mann page had been a much larger landholder than the second thomas jefferson or even isham randolph besides being a member of the council it was this mann page who had built rosewell in gloucester county and left the fabulous house to a son of the same name who spent most of his strength bearing the heavy burden in this huge threestoried mansion john had grown up jefferson was often to look at its mahogany wainscoting and climb its marble stair ways probably reflecting that his own forebears had been wise in not cultivating magnificence so extravagantly to a greater degree than jeffersons immediate ancestors the pages va hist register july p incomplete autobiography of page in va hist register july pp meade i tl especially for rosewell and churchmanship the extensive correspondence between him and jefferson will be cited frequently hereafter at the college were devoted to the church and associated with the college but john may have been removed from the presidents house at the time that poor dawson got into so much trouble and before the reverend wil liam yates came in he appears to have lodged in the college during the second year that his friend from albemarle was there and he may have been with him from the first he had secured a firm grounding in the classics from his revered tutor william price and like jeffer son he enjoyed the special attentions of william small both small and president dawson commended him to governor fauquier in religious matters he was more conventional than jefferson and being especially sociable he was more willing to leave his books there was no touch of genius on him but he was every inch a gentleman he was a fellow in philosophical inquiry until his boon companion probed more deeply and he was an intimate confidant in early matters of the heart since jefferson remained so long in williamsburg as a student it may be safely assumed that he knew practically everybody who at tended the college from to among his near contempo raries were these john walker who was destined to be a fellow burgess from albemarle william fleming to whom some of his earliest known letters were directed francis eppes to whom he was to be closely bound by marriage a couple of harrisons for one of whom he may later have designed brandon john tyler with whom he was to be associated as a law student austin and bernard moore to one of whom he was to address a memorable letter about the study of law jacquelin ambler who was to win a girl he dreamed of and bathurst skelton whose widow he was to marry later on some of these names are now remembered chiefly because of their association with his he overtopped his own college generation but even among its members he met future leaders of the colony and state thomas nelson junior who was to succeed him as governor in perilous times had gone to school abroad but was much in williamsburg in this period a more noted group came to the college somewhat later edmund randolph john taylor of caroline and that james madison who be came a bishop and early in the next decade appeared john marshall briefly and james monroe the james madison who was to succeed jefferson as president manifested a degree of unconventionality by at tending the college of new jersey at princeton but even without him this is an exceedingly distinguished list to those who heard of the recurrent disorders among the students at william and mary and of the dissensions within the faculty or be tween the faculty and the board the affairs of this historic college frovisional list of alumni w m ser i jefferson the virginian may well have seemed chaotic during the period that jefferson knew it best the successor to president dawson as commissary of the bishop of london the reverend william robinson thought that it had failed to answer the high ends of its institution and doubted if under exist ing conditions learning and religion would strike deep root in the colony he proposed that the college be really put under the care of the ecclesiastical authorities in england and be entirely divorced from local control there can be no doubt that the situation was anomalous but the school was more successful than he realized the secret of its success lay not in its organization not in its identification with the english church not even in its faculty but in its intimate association with the community in which it was placed the college could be no mere training school for clergymen though actually it produced better ministers for the colony than those who were imported directly from abroad the gentry had no strong de sire that it cultivate learning for its own sake for their ideal was the wellrounded man it was preeminently a school for statesmen and as such on the north american continent its product has never been excelled the extraordinary distinction of its alumni is chiefly owing to the fact that its students were by birth and station the potential leaders of the colony and that their college days were spent at the center of provincial life the most important fact about it was not that it was relatively old or that it had considerable resources but that it was located in williamsburg in this distinctive community jefferson as a young man met the leading gentlemen of the country and there before he was grown he saw visitors of quite a different sort the indians were in the habit of coming to the capital often in great numbers and he reports that he was much with them one historic visit occurred in the spring of and with brief mention of it we can end the story of his college days it was that of a cherokee chief whom he had seen before as the guest of his father at shadwell on previous journeys and he called him ontassete

and an embarrassingly large num ber eventually arrived in williamsburg the students must have talked about them and they may have observed outacity when he was dined at the college they doubtless heard that he was received by the gov ernor and council and granted permission to visit the great king his father in england they could hardly have anticipated the sensa tion which the cherokee created in london where he was visited by oliver goldsmith and painted by sir joshua reynolds but before his departure he made a profound impression on a youth who was nearing nineteen and who had not yet crossed the sea jefferson was in outa citys camp when he delivered a farewell oration to his people the eve ning before he sailed and as an old man he remembered the splendor of the moon the college student understood no word of the chiefs prayer for his own safety on the voyage and for that of his people until his return but outacitys resounding voice and the solemn si lence of his followers around their campfires filled him with awe and veneration years afterward as governor and president he was to receive visits from indians to address them as a father and to smoke with them the pipe of peace he was to observe this race as a philosopher and to in quire into its languages as a responsible statesman he was to grapple with the problem of depredations and massacres on the frontier but he was not soon if ever to escape from these early emotions at this time unquestionably he was moved not by fear but by curiosity and compassion nonetheless these warriors must have reminded him that the wilderness was not far away from the college halls he was quitting from the capitol where decorous statesmen deliberated from the pal ace ballroom where ladies and gentlemen danced the gay reel and the stately minuet of such contrasts was provincial life compounded williamsburg introduction to the law w hen jefferson first went to williamsburg as a student it is most unlikely that he had ever seen that large a town in virginia both norfolk and petersburg were larger though neither of these was im pressive in its size the major reason for the failure to develop com mercial centers in virginia he himself set forth a good many years after he left college our country being much intersected with navi gable waters and trade brought generally to our doors instead of our being obliged to go in quest of it has probably been one of the causes why we have no towns of any consequence important business was transacted in williamsburg but the place would never have become famous because of that legally it was a city and had been laid out on a pleasing plan but it covered only a square mile and had fewer than two thousand peo ple except during public times in the fall and spring when the courts sat and the assembly was generally in session its population was doubled or trebled then everybody of political consequence in the colony was there and the three

of a french traveller in the col onies i in american historical review ahr xxvi july williamsburg introduction to the law from the open space in front of the college between the presi dents house and the brafferton jefferson and the other students must often have looked down the noble great street to the capitol almost a mile away before his father was born the width of this central thoroughfare had been fixed at six poles or to all practical pur poses a hundred feet and afterwards it was named for the duke of gloucester in public times an incessant train of coaches could be seen plowing their way through the powdered oyster shells which looked like sand or through seas of mud depending on the weather walking was unpleasant at certain seasons because of the dust or the mud and virginians generally preferred to ride but often in his student days jefferson must have stretched his long legs on the duke of gloucester street before he reached bruton church where at times he listened to the arid preaching of the era he passed the home of the honorable john blair president of the council at an early date two daughters of this prominent family anne and betsey became his friends they lived in a pleasant white house with dormer windows a highpitched roof and outside chimneys at the ends it was set close to the sidewalk in conformity with the building laws and on summer nights the family and their guests used to sit on the steps and sing on this street gardens had to be behind the houses but greens and other open spaces had been left to permit free circulation of the air the brick church was almost at the halfway point and stood at the intersection of the palace green considerably beyond this was the printing office of the virginia gazette people often went there to insert notices about runaways to advertise the sale of parcels of likely virginiaborn wenches or to offer to the horsebreeding public the services of stallions in their prime when jefferson stopped there however it was generally to purchase books and music farther down the street was a tavern which had been named for sir walter raleigh and was shaped like the letter l it was to gain greatest renown in revolutionary times but its famous apollo room was already in use jefferson danced in it before he ever deliberated at the same place on affairs of state having proceeded so far one might easily go on a little farther to the capitol at the end of this broad street there peter jefferson had done brief service as a burgess but his son could not see the chamber where isham randolph had taken oath at an earlier time for this was a fairly new building erected after a fire jefferson later described it as on the singing w m i ser xvi on his friendship letters from and to elizabeth blair

of the propor tions of the ionic and thought this the most pleasing bit of archi tecture in virginia on the whole it can be seen no longer for the last part of it burned after jefferson was dead and it was not restored near the capitol in the s as now was the public gaol and beyond the capitol he could have come into still another world here was an open space known as the exchange where planters squared accounts with one another consigned tobacco to factors and sea cap tains and arranged to purchase negro fellows or some of those likely wenches here was the coffee house which jefferson frequented as a young man here was the second williamsburg theater where he like george washington purchased tickets for the play the gallows where criminals dangled after each session of the general court and the racecourse where heats of two three and four miles were run were outside the town he doubtless remembered the gallows after wards when he was drafting a bill dealing with crimes and punish ments and the racetrack may have interested him somewhat at first he had more freedom to go to that sort of place after he became a law student at the age of nineteen and had lodgings in town these could have been on either of the two narrower streets that paralleled the duke of gloucester or on some cross street but nobody knows just where they were he probably stayed at different places for a time he studied in the same room with john tyler and a much less serious young man from gloucester county named frank willis the latter who delighted in pranks sometimes overturned the table when he came in late and found the two others still at work by the time that jeffer son was grown he had his servant jupiter with him in williamsburg and during some of his years as a law student he kept horses there as his gay friend willis did but whether he walked or rode and what ever point he may have started from he went more often in the direc tion of the governors palace than the capitol at first turning from the duke of gloucester street at the palace green and passing the yard of bruton church he came to the home of george wythe here he stopped frequently to be greeted by a middlesized hooknosed gentleman who was noted for his courtly bow this dignified brick house became for jefferson a sort of anteroom to the palace though it had meaning in itself hi it has been

the leading architect or builder of the colony and whose daughter elizabeth had married wythe taliaferro had a plan tation a few miles out of town but he probably visited the childless couple and from him jefferson may have heard something about archi tecture wythe was not interested in that subject he was to be jeffer sons teacher in the law for considerable stretches during the next five years the younger man was at shadwell but he spent most of the time reading and he got his directions in williamsburg in the year when thomas jefferson finished college and began to study law george wythe was about thirtyfive years old if not yet the first at the bar of the general court he was already one of its most distinguished members among those who shared leadership with him were peyton randolph then kings attorney as his father and grandfather had been before him and the latters brother john who was to succeed him in that family office four years later both of these prominent relatives of jefferson were legal products of the inner temple in virginia in the eighteenth century as in maryland and south carolina the quality of the bar had been much improved by the influence of men who had been trained in england it was after jefferson had turned twenty that he wrote with appar ent seriousness to john page about going abroad he may have thought of accompanying william small and of making the grand tour but he did not mention the inns of court if he had gone to the inner tem ple he would doubtless have met charles carroll of carrollton and at the middle temple he could have found charles cotesworth pinckney of south carolina there would still have been time for him to hear william pitt in the commons and david garrick at the play at some table he might even have caught snatches of the conversation of sam uel johnson though there is little reason to suppose that he would have liked it he would have formed intercolonial friendships and become a citizen of the world

jefferson the virginian it is doubtful if he would have learned any more law or qualified himself any better for his historical role than he actually did by private study in his own colony there can be no possible question about his mature judgment of foreign education for americans for he said that a volume would be necessary to enumerate all its disadvantages he saw no need what ever for anybody except a student of medicine to go abroad among the many advantages of being educated at home was one very prac tical one and this he mentioned to one of his young friends cast your eye over america he said who are the men of most learning of most eloquence most beloved by their countrymen and most trusted and promoted by them they are those who have been educated among them and whose manners morals and habits are perfectly homogene ous with those of the country he made these patriotic observations more than twenty years after he began to study with wythe but if he had had to start all over again it is extremely unlikely that he would have changed his plan other leaders of the growing virginia bar like robert carter nicholas edmund pendleton and wythe himself had been educated locally and the approved method was that of reading in some lawyers office several years before jefferson entered the college john adams facing a similar problem of legal education in alassachusetts had made an agreement with james putnam of worcester to study for two years under his inspection while carrying on his own teaching in the local school formal legal instruction was not to begin until after the colonies had become states toward the end of the revolution under the inspiration of jefferson himself wythe was to assume a chair of law at the college of william and mary and a few years later tapping reeve was to set up his famous school at litchfield con necticut in deciding to study law jefferson had no such scruples to overcome as had troubled adams for the profession was in better odor in vir ginia and he had no craving for the church in the narrow sense it was not a profitable calling in this colony because of the jealousy of the dominant planters and their desire to discourage petty practitioners the fees of attorneys had been sharply restricted by statute but land to john banister jr whose name jefferson generally misspelled oct l b v j f warren discusses pp i the methods which prevailed in the colonies generally some students had to content themselves with studying in a clerks office and with reading on their own adams works i see also i h the important fact is that he like jefferson kept on studving jefferson could have read about these restrictions in his copy of john mercer williamsburg introduction to the law holders who followed the law could continue to draw upon their acres for support and the heir of peter jefferson doubtless expected to do just that realizing that it was one of his many privileges he was to pursue the law as a learned and useful profession with notable devotion until great public events deflected his course his choice of wythe as a guide instead of one of the randolphs or somebody else and wythes agreement to receive him were probably owing to their mutual friend william small he was eternally grateful for these good offices and always convinced of the wisdom of his decision not merely because his mentor was the most learned and possibly the most effective of the local group but also because of the greater range and liberality of his mind jefferson did not have a high opinion of the apprentice system as such for he recognized the temptation of a practising lawyer to throw too great a burden of office business on a student about two years after his admission to the bar he wrote to his uncle by marriage thomas turpin in regard to the latters son philip the only help a youth wants is to be directed what books to read and in what order to read them he himself probably looked up cases for his senior in the law library at the capitol he undoubtedly attended sessions of the general court and may have done some clerical service there and he probably was set to drawing papers in wythes office from the date of his earliest records jefferson was a careful draftsman and a good penman with a clear engrossing hand and he must have had immediate exercise in paper work it is unlikely though that he was ever an apprentice in any strict sense or that wythe ever wanted him to be one there is no existing record that he paid any fee and it is impossible to say just how long he was physically present in wythes office during his second year he studied for months after christmas at shadwell returning to williamsburg in the fall of his third after that he probably read wherever he liked and on his own schedule he followed an appallingly rigorous program most of the time un less the sincerity of his advice to others and the entries in his own notebooks are to be doubted he had a mild fling as a privileged young gentleman during the first two years and gave himself some time for an exact abridgement of all the public acts of assembly of va in force and use jan annotated copy at uva the successive acts can now be traced in hening feb in dickore two unpublished letters from thomas jefferson the exact location of the office has not been determined but there is every reason to suppose that it was on the place where there were plenty of out buildings jefferson the virginian such frivolities as are common between the ages of nineteen and twentyone but though the social gaieties of the provincial capital and of the plantation houses allured him at first it must have been before he entered upon what he called the business of life and while he was still primarily a student that he copied into his literary notebook a sobering extract about the shortage of time youth is not rich in time it may be poor part with it as with money sparing pay no moment but in purchase of its worth and what its worth ask deathbells they can tell part with it as with life reluctant big with holy hope of nobler time to come he never found hours enough to accomplish his intellectual pur poses in all that he said afterwards about the education of a lawyer he made it clear that the foundations must be both deep and broad knowledge of latin and french he regarded as absolutely necessary the first book that he used involved both of these languages though the french was not such as he was to hear later at the court of ver sailles he thought of mathematics and natural philosophy as studies too useful and delightful for anyone to miss and regarded them par ticularly mathematics as invaluable in exercising the mind he con tinued to make scientific observations with small until this teacher and friend left for england and if he needed any guidance in his continued reading of the classics wythe was abundantly qualified to supply it wythes early education had been handicapped by poverty though he inherited an estate after he became a man that he was largely self taught with his mothers help and that until the age of thirty he had devoted himself almost exclusively to the law did not prevent his becoming a noted classical scholar the best in virginia jefferson said an english traveler who had met wythe even earlier said that he had a perfect knowledge of greek and of ancient philosophy par ticularly the platonic he never lured jefferson into platonic paths literary bible of thomas jefferson hereafter cited as literary bible ed by gilbert chinard p quoting from youngs night thoughts on july he purchased a copy of youngs works as shown by the day books of the vet gazette throughout life he gave advice on request about the study of law the letter of aug to john minor enclosing copy of a paper written nearly fifty years earlier is most useful here because of its completeness and also because it reflects his early opinions see randall i andrew burnaby travels through north america p he met wythe in jeffersons nephew peter carr whose course wythe directed studied the williamsburg introduction to the law but he led him to improve his greek at which he was not so good as at latin wythe later injected classical quotations into his judicial opinions in a way that was little short of pedantic but early in his career he imbibed the spirit of ancient civilization at its best the afore said traveler who was generally critical of virginians said that to his classical learning he had joined such a profound reverence for the supreme being such respect for the divine laws such philanthropy for mankind such simplicity of manners and such inflexible rectitude and integrity of principle as would have dignified a roman senator even in the most virtuous times of the republic jefferson to whom the heroes of antiquity were more real than either the christian saints or modern historical figures described him as his countrys cato with out the romans avarice while someone else called him the american aristides thus showing that he was also an athenian despite his deserved reputation wythes intellectual interests were not so broad as his distinguished pupils afterwards were and his ap prehension was not so quick this moderate man may not have been disposed to attack learning on quite so wide a front probably he never drew up so long and formidable a list of subjects kindred to the law as jefferson afterwards commended to the young probably he did not expect his protege along with the law to study physics ethics religion natural philosophy belleslettres criticism rhetoric politics and history jeffersons recommendations suggest that the diet at wythes board was generous and wellbalanced but they also show the insatiable appetite of his own omnivorous mind wythe was a systematic man and probably encouraged him to work out a regular schedule without requiring him to fill every moment from dawn to bedtime if we may judge from jeffersons own recommendations the hours from eight to twelve in the morning when his mental vigor was greatest were devoted exclusively to the law the rest of the time except for a period of afternoon exercise was given to allied subjects he relegated literature and oratory to the evening hours but there is plenty of evidence that he did not neglect them he would hardly have recommended such a comprehensive and exacting schedule if he had not tried it out himself and he probably approximated his ideal after a year or two the technical study of the law was then a dreary ramble as john adams said for books that smoothed the students path did not exist textbooks of the modem sort were unknown and blackstones famous classics as well as the law with him carr to jefferson mar carr and cary papers tjva jefferson the virginian commentaries had not yet appeared all lawbooks had to be imported and there was a sad shortage of them in the colonies generally there were no american reports of cases english reports were scarce and in most colonies collections of their own statutes were hard to get few people in virginia could ever boast a complete set and the col lection which jefferson eventually amassed was notable in its time at the beginning an abridgment of the acts of assembly was available to him this extended to january and by his annotations he brought and kept it up to date as colonial conditions went williams burg was rich in legal resources and like john adams he became a systematic purchaser of such books as were obtainable he never lacked food though it must often have seemed unpalatable wythe started him on coke upon littleton which constituted the first of four parts of the institutes of the lawes of england he would probably have been directed to the same book if he had gone to one of the inns of court for it had been the lawyers primer in its home land for more than a century and a dozen editions of it had appeared in the course of time this student was to gain a conception of the law not as an immutable system but as something that lives and moves he had no immediate reason to expect that however when he began to struggle with the black letter text and uncouth but cunning leam ning of sir edward coke coke had reprinted in the norman french the classic treatise of litdeton on tenures which he regarded as the most perfect and abso lute work that was ever written in any humane science had added an english translation and had heaped around the text in bewilder ing mass his own definitions and learned notes to the beginner this folio must have seemed heavy and formidable but if he did not wander too far afield he might learn here just how land was held in vir ginia as in the mother country this was a matter of the first impor tance this primer of legal learning was more than a book to jefferson it was a person he packed him in a trunk before leaving williams burg for a stay at shadwell possibly hoping to smother him he called him an old dull scoundrel and he consigned him to the devil adams works iii n warren hist am bar ch vui r s morris jefferson as a lawyer proes am philos soc vol no july

men expressed themselves even more strongly the old jurist profoundly discouraged john quincy adams and daniel web ster and he drove joseph story actually to tears but these were younger men not bred in so stem a school jefferson learned from wythe as john adams did from jeremiah gridley that there was no choice but to conquer coke he gained deep respect for him as young story did and in long retrospect he preferred cokes crabbed text and uncouth learning to the honeyed words of blackstone which were so much easier to understand old coke was not unsympathetic indeed he counseled the begin ner wisely mine advice to the student is that before he read any part of our commentaries upon any section that first he read again and again our author himself in that section and do his best en deavours first of himself and then by conference with others which is the life of study to understand it and then to read our commentary thereupon and no more at any one time than he is able with a delight to bear away and after to meditate thereon which is the life of reading if george wythes student followed cokes excellent advice this is the passage in the english translation of the text which he read first tenant in feesimple is he which hath lands or tenements to hold to him and his heirs for ever and it is called in latin feodum simplex for feodum is the same that inheritance is and simplex is as much as to say lawful or pure and so feodum sim plex signifies a lawful or pure inheritance then if his eye happened to stray to the notes in the adjoining col umn he could have observed that tenant is derived of the verb teneo and hath in the law five significations cokes definitions word by word and phrase by phrase were there for him to read and ponder over he probably did not share cokes reverence for the text very long and in the end the notes must have seemed minute they even ex tended to littletons use of an etc this was not the best place to discover broad legal principles but when jefferson in the next decade moved in the virginia house of delegates that tenants in fee tail should hold their lands in fee simple and thus acquire a pure inheritance he could have reflected that he first learned the meaning of these cru warren cites numerous comments pp the reference to john adams is from works ii when he was aged preface jefferson the virginian cial terms from littleton and coke even the physical form of this old commentary unusual in its own day in england left a lasting impres sion the manuscript of one of the bestknown bills that he ever drafted for his native commonwealth reveals cokes unmistakable in fluence in the notes which first accompany and then invade the col umned text in the course of time he studied the three other parts of the famous institutes one contained the texts of english statutes from magna carta to the time of james i another dealt with criminal law and the last was a treatise on jurisdiction for long years he considered this work the basis of legal study and he commended it again and again he soon became aware however that the law had developed since cokes day that new laws had been added by legislatures and that new developments of old laws had been brought about by judges he was quite willing to use later digests and treatises and specifically recommended matthew bacons abridgment lord kames on equity and other books of the sort the modernity of his legal training is most striking in the study and the emphasis he gave to the actual cases that were argued and adjudged in the courts of england john adams was equally interested in pursuing the law back to its historic foun tains and he also talked of bracton and other men of ancient learning but neither he nor any other of jeffersons contemporaries has left a comparable record of attention to the reporters it was in connection with these reports of cases that jefferson began after a few years to keep commonplace books his notes of his read ing contain more detailed information about his legal studies than is generally available for the great lawyers of his or any other american generation these old notes are important documents in the history of the case system they may now seem wearisome except to legal antiquarians but there is freshness and timelessness in the advice he gave a young contemporary toward the end of his own training in reading the reporters enter in a commonplace book every case of value condensed into the narrowest compass possible which will admit of presenting distinctly the principles of the case this operation is doubly useful insomuch as it obliges the student to seek out the pith of the case and habituates him to a condensation of thought and to an acquisition of the most valu j a bai proportioning crimes and punishments lc these physical qualities do not appear in the published versions jefferson said much about bracton in his muchquoted letter to thomas ooper jan l b xiv but in

using two words where one will do it fixes the case too more indelibly in the mind under wythe he started with coke whose lore could not be ab stracted and he proceeded step by step until he finally reached ma turity from his study of the cases during his unhurried period of legal tutelage he formed enduring habits of study while under the influence of men as well as books ideas germinated within his fertile mind his law teacher besides being a classicist and a courtly gentleman was a successful practitioner at the bar of die general court and an esteemed member of the house of burgesses jefferson soon seeing him in action in both places noted his easy elocution and chaste lan guage and his urbanity in debate he himself was to be more precipitate in politics and eventually he took the lead but there was never a rift between him and his old friend always there was mutual respect and affection in jeffersons early history the name of george wythe is insep arable from those of william small and francis fauquier his intimate association with this trio as a trio must have begun before when small went back to england and jefferson himself became twentyone it may have dated from his college days but it probably took form soon after he began to study law he was not yet grown when by happy chance he was regularly admitted as a fourth member of the party which had been dining frequently at the palace since the gov ernors family had returned home at these dinners jefferson said long afterward he heard more good sense more rational and philosophical conversations than at any other time in his life his muchquoted statement may reflect the imperfect memory of an old man and the exaggerated emphasis of age on youthful experience but unquestion ably it contains a nugget of important truth he was to know wythe much the longest of the three and to love him most this learned temperate and kindly gentleman not quick to randall i the commonplace book of thomas jefferson ed

a magnificent structure fin ished and beautified with gates and gardens offices and walks or chards and a fine canal the ballroom wing had been added in the meantime but little had been spent on the estate in the last decade in his maturity jefferson did not regard the large brick mansion as handsome but since he had measured it he spoke advisedly about the spaciousness of its interior he liked the situation and thought that if the grounds were developed it might be made an elegant seat one can only guess what his opinion of it would be in its present restored perfection but in his student days when he dined and performed in amateur musicals at the palace he undoubtedly found more elegance there than he had ever before observed his host was francis fauquier who continued to be the chief resi dent official of the province until a year after jefferson was admitted to the bar he afterwards described fauquier as the ablest man who ever filled the chair of government in williamsburg

any case when he first met this governor however his own mind was not yet turned to affairs of state and he knew his predeces sor chiefly as a gentleman as a patron of learning and as a friend of the arts fauquier had come to virginia at the age of fiftyfour two years before jefferson entered college he was the son of a huguenot physi cian who took refuge in england found employment at the mint un der sir isaac newton married an englishwoman and eventually became a director of the bank of england francis was bom in lon don and until about the time of his marriage into a county family he followed a military career he then appears to have lived the life of a country gentleman in hertfordshire his uncle william a successful merchant who was addicted to scientific studies made him his heir and after the death of this uncle he became like him a director of the south sea company and a fellow of the royal society he is said to have been well regarded in the merchant group and he had many acquaint ances in philosophical circles the story long current in virginia that his appointment as lieuten ant governor was owing to the compassion of lord anson after the latter had won his entire patrimony in a single nights play at cards emphasizes one aspect of his reputation but cannot be accepted as sober fact appointments to colonial offices in the eighteenth century cannot always be fully explained but this one may be attributed in part to the reputation which fauquier had gained through a pamphlet published by him the year before the death of peter jefferson dedi cated to lord anson it dealt with the burning question of financial support for the war with france and it attracted enough attention to warrant two additional editions it was of advantage to fauquier in virginia that he followed an unpopular governor and it was to his credit there that he endeavored to maintain harmonious relations between the colony and the authori ties at home in the ecclesiastical

great personal popularity may be attributed to the fact that he was possessed of all the social virtues in an eminent degree and that he found among the people or at least the leaders of the colony a character compounded of the same elements as his own the great landholders whom he received at the palace and visited during the recess of the assembly and the courts found in his manners a model such as some of them had seen in england and others had read about in books here was the compleat gentleman in living form he had classical learning of the kind that was associated with the names of the second richard lee and the second william byrd and was exemplified among his contemporaries by george wythe his patronage of science may have chiefly impressed young sters like thomas jefferson and john page but die high favor with which william small was regarded by leading men shows that it was far from unwelcome at the time in this respect as in others fauquier was fashionable and modem he was a curious observer of natural phenomena who discussed current philosophical questions with his appreciative friends exam ples of his own observations survive during his first year in the col ony he sent to his brother in england an account of a strange hail storm which descended upon williamsburg on an unusually hot sunday afternoon in july when this was communicated to the royal society the savants could have noted with satisfaction that the hailstones were described with scientific precision both as to their shape and size the storm broke every pane of glass on the north side of the palace and destroyed the garden and the governor cooled his wine and froze cream with some of the ice next day young jefferson must have heard this story after he came to town and he may have gained from fauquier his first ideas about the regular recording of the temperature and winds the latter kept a diary of the weather in williamsburg for just the years that his young friend was there in college and after wards turned this over to an english traveler who published it as an appendix to a book it was precisely the sort of record that jefferson himself kept so religiously at monticello

as the most valuable part of his collection jefferson the virginian gambling the later statement that he introduced the fatal propensity to gaming into virginia seems extreme in view of the practices which had been observed there before he came but he encouraged these by his own example and had a part in making gambling a fashionable form of vice this was a time of extravagance and losses are said to have been dangerously high in his day in williamsburg a traveler observed that in the taverns at night there was carousing and drinking in one chamber and a box and dice in the other and that this sort of thing lasted till morning he went so far as to say that there was not a public house in virginia but had its tables all battered with dice boxes how deeprooted such evils were no traveler could really judge but more sober years were coming just prior to the revolu tion a young tutor observed in westmoreland that a new spirit of seriousness had entered virginia life that seriousness was exemplified by george washington and by thomas jefferson himself there was more recklessness in the golden decade of fauquier when there were fewer great things for men to do jefferson said that when he was assailed by moral temptation during his youth and young manhood he used to ask himself how small or wythe or peyton randolph would act he did not invoke the example of fauquier at the governors table he heard highly stimulating conversation and in this court he acquired graces which adorned his life but he found his moral standards elsewhere he did not pick up such vices as his elegant host exemplified unless generosity and love of elegance should be accounted vices but a certain longing for magnifi cence in the spirit of the renaissance could be observed among rich virginia planters and found early expression in the career of thomas jefferson he may have got it from his countrymen or from his read ing but he may have caught it from francis fauquier it was probably after jefferson had begun to study law under george wythe that the musical governor who was a good performer himself associated him with two or three other amateurs in the weekly concerts at the palace he may have neglected his instrument for his books while he was at the college but he afterwards reported that for twelve years before the revolution he played no fewer than three hours a day m while he was still

performer he was not to know again he had no chance to see sculpture or fine paintings there but traveling companies brought comic operas from time to time and music was cultivated by amateurs the professional authority of the place was peter pelham son of a mezzotint artist of boston and organist of bruton church who supplemented his income by taking pupils among them jeffer sons friend anne blair at a later time he gained a further supplement by assuming the incongruous position of keeper of the public gaol he then gave condemned criminals a chance to hear music before their execution taking them to the church in shackles in later years he often played for jefferson who treated him afterwards or paid him for his pains the auditor filled the role of generous patron at that time and place the status of the professional was inferior jefferson was hardly proficient enough for the first violin part at the palace he probably had the second part and may even have played on the cello for he was a passable performer on that instru ment at a later time the first violinist was probably john randolph brother of peyton he was not only a lawyer he published a book on gardening which jefferson acquired councillor robert carter a close friend of the governor who played on the harpsichord and the german flute was probably a member of the group in his house next door to the palace he installed an organ which had been built for him in london and it is likely that jefferson heard music there he was unsuccessful in his later attempt to purchase this instrument it is possible that john page participated in the concerts jefferson bought fiddlestrings regularly before visiting his friend at rosewell and undoubtedly he played there there was a musical accompani ment to many of jeffersons most intimate associations throughout the first half of his life and it was probably during these years at williams burg that music became the favorite passion of his soul afterwards he

musicals in the palace ballroom to a degree he played a con ventional part elsewhere as a young gentleman his friendship with older men is one of many signs of the essential seriousness of his na ture they perceived it and reposed more confidence in him than might have been expected at his age and he in turn valued their com panionship because he could learn so much from them in his rela tions with his contemporaries he soon became discriminating he never suffered fools gladly and it is hard to think of him as ever having been intellectually immature as a recognized member of the younger gentry however he participated in the customary social life and in the doing showed that in certain important respects he had not yet attained the full stature of a man even though he now towered a couple of inches beyond six feet his social activities were natural and innocent he danced at the raleigh tavern visited at plantation houses made wagers with girls gossiped about courtships and as time went on served as an attendant at weddings he was and remained part of a closeknit social group and he knew well the favored sons and daughters of this fertile land during the months that he spent away from williamsburg which he sometimes called devilsburg he often bemoaned the lack of com panionship to john page he wrote once from shadwell all things here appear to me to trudge on in one and the same

youthful effusions which john page and william fleming preserved and which in the absence of other records his biographers have worn so bare they do not reveal half enough but they disclose a great deal which the mature man would not have rel ished they are not without charm and cleverness for he had already learned to turn a happy phrase but they are filled with learned con ceits which are not at all characteristic of one who afterwards wore the mantle of scholarship lightly as a gentleman was supposed to do their humor is often labored for grace did not yet compensate for die lack of striking wit worst of all they are full of references to girls these would have horrified him in later years when he was so reticent about personal affairs and particularly about his relations with womankind the dignity and restraint of middle age were more characteristic and also more becoming his earliest letters are interspersed with quotations from the classics with an occasional phrase in french he referred to friends and ac quaintances by using rough latin equivalents parvus for william small and currus for dabney carr he wrote to william fleming as will but john page he addressed as dear page his use of familiar given names probably declined from the time that he left maurys school and it ceased when he and his friends attained matu rity then formality became the rule while still in the familiar stage he spoke of alice corbin with whom he had bet a pair of garters of sukey potter whom he hoped will fleming would marry though actually he did not of nancy wilton whom page appears to have courted briefly of jenny taliaferro who played the spinet and sang well most of all he talked of rebecca burwell she provided the only romantic story of his youth but it is not a particularly good one he was an indecisive suitor and emerged too rarely from the realm of thought this girl whom he referred to as rb becca belinda campana in die and adnileb on the pretense that some of these thin disguises would deceive all but his closest friends was an orphan with the best of connections her father became a member of the council in the year that thomas jefferson was bom he was present when joshua fry and peter jefferson reported that they had extended the dividing line as acting governor he consulted the board about employing them to draw a map of the inhabited part of virginia and soon after that he died the date of the death of rebeccas mother ford i council journals colonial va v he took his seat aug became acting governor on nov and continued until jefferson the virginian is uncertain but when jefferson met her the orphaned girl was in the charge of her uncle by marriage william nelson of york also a councillor and afterwards acting governor he is generally re ferred to as president nelson while his brother thomas is known as secretary nelson and his own son thomas is usually called the signer it was the latter who succeeded jefferson as governor of the commonwealth during the revolution jefferson addressed him as dear nelson and long maintained intimate relations with this wealthy and influential family as was natural enough in view of his friendship with john page he may have met rebecca on a visit to york or rosewell but he probably saw her first in williamsburg when her guardian was there attending to his official duties the tradition is that she was beautiful and according to the scanty record she was also good bishop meade gentle annalist of vir ginia churches ministers and families approvingly quotes a passage describing her pious resignation in the early loss of her parents and attributing to her a religious enthusiasm which distinguished her from her giddy companions william nelson himself was a zealous church man for all his interest in racing horses and in later life rebecca appears to have been deeply religious in the conventional sense the jefferson of history was not that but it is possible that an element in her attraction for him in his youth was that she was somewhat more serious than the other girls he thought himself deeply in love during the winter before he was twenty and while she was still sixteen he was at shadwell that winter and his struggles with cokes tough primer of the law were being interrupted by romantic thoughts early marriage was the rule rather than the exception in his class but he had also begun to dream of a trip abroad and he spoke of this as a virtual necessity though as a mat ter of fact he never made it he belabored his puzzled mind trying to decide what to do and revealed his tortuous mental processes to his confidant john page should he end his suspense by going down to receive his sentence and at the same time run the risk of being ten times more wretched than before would page join him on his travels in a vessel to be called the rebecca in which they would sail to many lands including italy where a good fiddle could be bought if so they might

ground for hope he wanted to ask her to wait until he had come back but wondered if this would not seem an unreasonable request if she consented he would be happy if not he would be as contented as he could per fect happiness was probably not intended for human creatures any way and one must learn to be resigned others of their gay friends would be amused by such sober reflections he feared but page would understand all this was in the mood of adolescence though the language was learned and some of the passages show that his mind had already taken a speculative turn he was enjoying his reflective sadness as well as his recurrent hopes a rival had appeared during his absence but despite pages urging he was not yet willing to approach re beccas guardian he must put the problem before the girl herself president nelson would doubtless have chuckled had he heard him in the fall back in williamsburg jefferson wrote hopefully to will fleming but soon sent a melancholy note to page before he went to dance with belinda in the apollo room he had dressed up his thoughts in the most moving language but when the time came his actual sentences were few and disordered while the pauses were fre quent and long it was unfortunate that he did not write to her in stead of trusting to his stammering speech his pen was his strongest weapon and the stilted extravagances of the time would not have seemed artificial to her as they do to almost any reader now somewhat later he managed to say his piece he talked about the necessity of his trip to england and deliberately refrained from asking an outright question though he informed the young lady that such a question would be asked at some later time to her the remote pros pect did not seem alluring and this he must have sensed for he made no effort to see her again he explained this inactivity to others on the ground that he had been abominably lazy but the probability is that he was now deeper in the law than in love his rival was more aggressive in the spring shortly before jeffersons twentyfirst birthday rebecca became engaged to jacquelin ambler who was somewhat older than jefferson and had really made up his mind years later as a member of the council of state he was closely associated with jefferson as governor of virginia and later still he served with honor and great personal popularity as treasurer of the commonwealth the revolution seriously affected his fortunes it also brought him a prize soninlaw whom jefferson afterwards disliked at yorktown in mary on ambler ibid i v a mag xviii jefferson the virginian ambler daughter of jacquelin and rebecca met captain john mar shall and three years later in richmond she became his wife ambler acted more like an adult than his rival did in and jefferson carried on this rather absurd affair mostly in his imagination but there was no little wisdom at the base of his uncertainty before he encumbered himself with a family he had many important things to do and although he did not go to england he did apply himself to his studies with an intensity which a young wife could hardly have been expected to approve such thoughts were doubtless in his mind when he copied into his literary notebook the following strong passage from an eighteenthcentury playwright wed her no were she all desire could wish as fair as would the vainest of her sex be thought with wealth beyond what womans pride could waste she should not cheat me of my freedom marry when i am old weary of the world i may grow desperate and take a wife to mortify withal other entries even more antifeminist lead to the supposition that this unhappy experience cured him temporarily of his hankering for girls from paradise lost he transcribed this o why did god creator wise that peopld highest heavn with spirits masculine create at last this novelty on earth this fair defect of nature and not fill the world at once with men as angels without feminine or find some other way to generate mankind the women of his day in virginia had few intellectual advantages and like an english traveler who had recently passed that way he may have concluded that they were unequal to any interesting and refined conversation during the next few years he found satisfaction in friendship with men when he passed philosophical evenings at rose well with john page or talked about the law with dabney carr on an albemarle hillside he was relatively free from disturbing thoughts a j beveridge life of john marshall i from otways orphan quoted in literary bible p ibid n p burnaby travels p the school of manners about the fair defect of nature dabney carr was likewise reading coke and matthew bacon and he also set high value on the blessings of science according to jefferson he had every excellence which good sense learning or virtue could give it was of boon companions such as these that he thought when he copied into his notebook a passage from euripides nothing is better than a reliable friend not riches not absolute sovereignty nay more the crowd is not to be reckoned with in exchange for a noble friend this saying did more than match a fleeting mood it voiced a convic tion which grew deeper through the years he was ever afterwards restrained in his comments on individual women but it was always easy for him to wax sentimental about a friend it was no accident that his life was extraordinarily rich in friendship for he cultivated this unceasingly and made of it an art in a moment of irreparable personal loss after he had begun to grow old he wrote john page but friends we have if we have merited them those of our earliest years stand nearest in our affections with regard to this first group however he did not regard himself as wholly fortunate this was chiefly because of his own longevity for the companions of his youth vanished from the field before he did some of them also were eventually parted from him by political differences though he regarded this as an insuffi cient cause it was while he was president that he said to page of our college friends and they are the dearest how few have stood with us in the great political questions which have agitated our country i did not believe the lilliputian fetters of that day strong enoug to have bound so many r when he was studying law the period of policed strife was remote but his two best

fleeting form and as nowhere else the gentleness and tenderness of his nature but ins to thomas stone mar in lc lit bible p june l b xi jefferson the virginian marriage did not occur until eight or nine years after his imaginative quest of rebecca burwell no picture of jefferson as a young gentleman survives but there is a good deal of information about the general social environment in which he lived during his student years at that time the standards which fauquier personified and accentuated were already set the governor did not introduce them they had been transplanted from england in the first place and in the unequal and dispersed society of a sunny agricultural province they had assumed characteristic local form the polish and elegance of colonial society can be easily exag gerated and unquestionably there was much crudity behind the fagade even in the best circles in virginia there was less smoothness than jefferson afterwards observed in paris where the roughness of the human mind was so rubbed off that one might glide through life with out a jostle nevertheless good manners were an essential feature of the prevailing pattern even in the relatively fashionable period of fau quiers governorship the gentleman did not need to be a dandy and at a later time he was proudly indifferent to the externalities of dress ideally however the gentleman was hospitable and generous courteous in his relations with his peers chivalrous toward women and kind to inferiors not everybody was mannerly even the governor was rude under provocation but there was a high standard of politeness which the gentry recognized and generally observed politeness as jefferson afterwards remarked is artificial good humor and a valuable preserva tive of peace and tranquillity the grandson to whom he made this observation preserved a story of the mollifying effects of the best virginia manners and this probably came from jefferson himself the sheriff of one of the river counties who was described as a selfmade man though he founded a distin guished family had strong prejudices against the aristocrats approach ing the seat of one of the proudest of these on a business errand and seeing him before the house the sheriff resolved not to dismount but when he drew near he was greeted by the gentleman with such suavity dignity and winning grace of manner that before he became aware of it he found himself standing before him hat in hand this grandson struck by the common quality of politeness in the older gentlemen of virginia who differed in so many other ways asked his for an excellent discussion of die ideals and standards of the gentry see l b wright first gentlemen of virginia the comments of burnaby in travels pp are less favorable to t j randolph nov ford dc the school of manners grandfather for an explanation to this jefferson replied that they had all been trained in williamsburg the finest school of manners and morals that ever existed in america in view of his comments on his own personal difficulties and tempta tions during his youth it is surprising that he should have commended the morals as well as the manners of a place where students rioted periodically and drinking and gambling were so rife he said that he was thrown into the society of cardplayers horse racers and fox hunters and left no doubt that he regarded such company as bad this statement however must be read side by side with other later remarks of his about the grave dangers of dissipation which american students would face in england in the course of time he came to regard wil liamsburg as a relatively moral place in this society pleasure and conviviality were not frowned upon and certain personal vices were condoned the unpardonable sins were lying and meanness of spirit plain speech to ones peers was not ex pected insofar as possible the gentleman was supposed to please the educational ideal was that of the wellrounded man who was decently familiar with the classics reasonably current with philosophy and had at least a bowing acquaintance with the arts only in the fields of plan tation affairs and government was he expected to be a specialist there is no more reason to suppose that jefferson uncritically ac cepted the entire social code than that he contented himself with meeting the minimal requirements of education he conformed out wardly to the prevailing social standards but he escaped the charac teristic vices well into mature manhood he made small wagers but in no real sense was he a gambler after he became grown it is doubtful if he was ever much of a drinker though he acquired a wellstocked cellar in due course and eventually became a connoisseur of wines in these early years he dressed as fastidiously as his companions he enjoyed dancing and as a matter of course he rode at no time prob ably was this foe of indolence and lover of books quite conventional but he responded quickly to refinement and he was rarely if ever coarse he became a penetrating critic of the society in which he was bom and bred but socially he was in all respects a gentleman his distinction lies in the fact that he became a great deal more memoirs of t j randolph edgehill randolph papers uva pp on listening at the capitol t he college the wythe house the palace the capitol these were the focal centers of jeffersons life in williamsburg during his student years the capitol was last in point of time but it proved the most important in the end for it became a major scene of his own action williamsburg was more than an academic village and a school of manners it was the seat and school of provincial government he could see the political institutions of the colony in actual operation all the more easily because the place was small and could become personally acquainted with the able men who made them work the governor whom jefferson knew so well and admired so much was the visible representative of the fardistant king whose birthday was regularly celebrated in the town and whose name appeared on all public documents of any note around fauquier was gathered a coun cil of a dozen wealthy and influential men jefferson became friends with several of these in the course of social life he first became familiar with the council as an official body in its capacity as the high est provincial court of law in order to learn his future business he went as a listener to the general court the capitol was built in the form of the letter h and the general court was held in one wing on the first floor while the burgesses met in the other there was little occa sion for him to climb to the second floor where committees met and the council sat in executive session but he knew the first floor well and there observed the house of burgesses knowledge of it and its members was an important part of the education of future leaders such as the sons of the gentry were deemed to be through george wythe jefferson soon became personally ac quainted with edmund pendleton whose prowess as a debater he afterwards attested at an early time he marked pendleton as a leader ahr xxvi listening at the capitol of die conservatives but from the beginning he regarded him as a friend not until he himself went to the bar did jefferson become intimate with his mothers cousin peyton randolph now kings attorney and soon to be speaker of the house but he saw this large man in action he was always impressed with peyton randolphs intelligence but never by his ability as a speaker considerably older was another first cousin of jane randolph jefferson a cousin whom her son regarded as the most learned of the elder group of statesmen profound in constitutional lore richard bland looked something like the old parchments which he handled and studied so much more than any other single man probably he laid the philosophical founda tions of the resistance to the mother country but jefferson noted that he also was an ungraceful speaker it was the greatest of the virginia orators who gave wide currency to these doctrines and of all the burgesses it was he who most impressed the young man at first from the time that he heard patrick henry as a student he regarded him as preeminent in the forensic field in his maturity jefferson was no admirer of mere oratory but he never questioned the power of eloquence and even in extreme old age he commended the study of it to youth he gave it a recognized place in his own program believing that a law student should read and analyze works of oratory and thus become acquainted with the ele vated style he copied out examples of english eloquence some of them now obscure he found chaste specimens in livy sallust and tacitus and during his evening hours he read demosthenes and cicero whom he continued to regard as the finest models for the forum and the bar while he was still in college he heard a cherokee chief de liver an oration which he never forgot and three years later he stood at the door of the chamber of the burgesses listening spellbound to patrick henry this memorable experience constituted more than an introduction to vivid local eloquence it was also a striking example of the sort of political education which as a potential leader he re ceived in williamsburg he had met patrick henry in hanover county more than five years earlier this was at the

season and the younger of them afterwards reflected that the elder engaged in no conversation which might have given the measure of his information or of his mind after jefferson had been exposed to small wythe and fauquier however it became evident to him that henry was no man of science and learning to jefferson his passion seemed to be for fiddling dancing and pleasantry in the last of which he particularly excelled though he was solemnity itself in public his manners had something of die coarseness of the poor hunters with whom he loved to pursue deer in the piney woods and to crack jokes around the campfire he was no fashionable gen tleman though his lineage was reputable he was one who was in stinctively attracted to people of the common sort both as a fiddler and as a statesman he played by ear and jefferson himself was among the many whom he charmed during the spring following their first meeting henry took his examination for the bar in williamsburg when after six weeks of study he was passed by a learned board under circumstances which have led to considerable historical dispute the severity of jeffersons later comments on henrys legal learning when the latters biographer asked him about the orator have been attributed by some writers to the alienation between the two men which occurred toward the end of the revolution the most serious of his criticisms however can be explained on equally human but less political grounds he referred a number of times to henrys laziness and lack of precise information while recognizing his great public services and his imaginative genius the contrast between his own painstaking preparation for the bar and henrys casual knowledge of the law when first examined could hardly have failed to strike him

chiefly by hard work while his less learned contemporary attained fame as a jury lawyer almost at a bound jefferson had the scholars contempt for shortcuts and his own talent was of another sort he probably thought little about the intellectual limitations of pat rick henry however when the latter called on him in the spring that he became seventeen or even when as a practising lawyer the orator regularly stopped with him in williamsburg if he afterwards questioned the possibility of henrys ever having read livy or any other book more than once at the outset he was probably attracted by the engaging personality and was undoubtedly impressed by the native genius of the man more than any other prominent leader in the province henry sensed the feelings of the inarticulate and appealed to the unformed west whence jefferson himself had sprung for in tellectual stimulus and cultivated conversation the law student went elsewhere but he gained the most important of his early political impressions from the selftaught lawyer who spoke at the capitol against the stamp act as jefferson had never heard man speak be fore this was on thursday may when he was twentytwo if the dull monotony of a colonial subservience of which he after wards complained was not broken at this time it was sharply punctu ated the public character of virginians at this date was hardly one of subservience to the mother country a traveler who had come that way in fauquiers time remarked they are haughty and jealous of their liberties impatient of restraint and can scarcely bear the thought of being controlled by any superior power on the other hand this visitor also reported that they never refused necessary supplies to the government when called upon and that they were characteristically a loyal and generous people both loyalty and jealous independence of spirit had marked the previous discussion of the stamp tax and of this young jefferson had heard his teacher george wythe had played a part in the actions of the assembly in the previous fall when an address was dispatched to the king and memorials were sent to the lords and commons protesting against the proposed internal tax on both practical and constitutional grounds wythe drew a draft of one of these papers but as he told jefferson it was toned down by his colleagues on the committee presumably on the advice of fauquier the subject matter of these randall i to john adams mar l b xvi burnaby travels ed p he was in virginia in jefferson the virginian dignified documents as the governor aptly said was praying to be permitted to tax themselves there had been no response to the prayer however and in the spring of the notorious act had been passed by parliament and assented to by the king though it was not to go into effect until the following november neither the governor nor the local leaders seem to have expected any action on this question at the may session of the assembly the business was nearly done and all but a third of the burgesses had gone home when a new member took the veterans by surprise jefferson probably heard that his friend from hanover had presented to the committee of the whole on wednesday certain resolutions which would be debated next day he may not have learned that they got into the mails in advance of final action they aroused heated com ment as far away as boston and sounded the alarm bell of the ameri can revolution if any single writing did jefferson could not fail to hear it for he was near by there was then no gallery in the capitol so he took his stand on that thursday between the lobby and the burgess chamber along with his younger friend john tyler who was still studying law with robert carter nicholas here they heard patrick henry make a speech in which he mentioned caesar and brutus charles i and crom well and uttered the name of george iii as they remembered it half a century afterwards he was then stopped with cries of treason and extricated himself from a predicament by adding that this mon arch might profit from example a contemporary account gives a milder version of the famous passage but a minor lapse of memory on the part of two old men who had heard the traditional version in the meantime would be quite forgivable jefferson also said that fre quently when listening to henry he closed his eyes and afterwards was unable to

at the capitol impression that this speech made on him however there can be no question whether or not anybody accused henry of treason the responsible leaders of the colony were unwilling to go quite so far in formal action as he desired like the governor jefferson reported that the resolu tions were opposed by speaker john robinson peyton randolph and george wythe and he added the names of pendleton and bland their ground was that the same principles had been set forth in the stillunanswered address and memorial of the previous session and that the latter were more likely to be effective because of their more conciliatory tone in their judgment the question was essentially one of method if not one of manners henry was bolder than they had been for he attacked the stamp act after its passage rather than before and his audacity had its reward the members of the ruling group were reluctant to yield any part of their leadership to one whom they re garded as a rash upstart but it is a measure of their political wisdom that most of them accepted him before long two of the resolutions were either defeated or withheld on the day that henry made his speech though both of them got into the papers elsewhere another was passed by a single vote this boldly asserted the exclusive right of the assembly to lay taxes and stated that every attempt to vest such power in any other person or persons whatsoever had a manifest tendency to destroy both british and american free dom jefferson regarded it as the strongest of them all and said that the debate on it was most bloody it was after the passage of this resolution that he heard portly peyton randolph say as he came puffing out of the door by god i would have given one hundred guineas for a single vote on the next day before the burgesses met the young law student stood at the end of the clerks table and watched colonel peter randolph then a member of the council thumb over the volumes of the journal trying to find a precedent for the expung ing of a vote he could not recall whether his former guardian found the erasure he was looking for but he noted that soon afterwards a motion was carried to

reported that there was a change of heart on the part of some of the timid members by implication he afterwards ap proved of the expunged resolution and sympathized with the young hot and giddy members as fauquier described them the four reso lutions which were passed said quite enough about the taxation of ttxo people by their own representatives and about the established prac tice of colonial selfgovernment to put virginia clearly on record and his law teacher who was so intimate with the governor thought that even this reiterated statement was unnecessary at the time ve cannot be sure that jefferson disagreed with wythe and fauquierr at twentytwo but his later comments imply that he was no more appalled by the alleged rashness of henrys course then than he was afterwards reviewing the matter in old age he spoke of the exact conformity of their opinions also he noted that the resolutions were supported chiefly by the vote of the middle and upper country the implications of this observation were later revealed in his own political career he may not have witnessed the stirring incident which occurred in the following october when the stamps arrived in williamsburg but he was there that month and could hardly have escaped hearing about it for the hero was his friend the governor though fauquier had regretted the action of patrick henry in may he realized that oppo sition to the stamp act had crystallized since that time and obviously regarded the measure as unenforceable the actual presence of colonel mercer with the stamps constituted an embarrassment and placed him in a situation requiring more circumspection he said than he had ever before displayed going to the coffee house beyond the capitol he was sitting on the porch with the speaker and several members of the council when colonel mercer came thither followed by a crowd which fauquier would have called a mob had he not known the gentle men of property who composed it he described the subsequent events in a colorful letter to the board of trade i immediately heard a cry see the governor take care of him those who were pushing up the steps immediately fell back and left a small space between me and them if your lord ships will not accuse me of vanity i would say that i believe this to be partly owing to the respect they bore to my character and partly to the love they bore my person tyler henry p nov burgesses journals pp ixviiilxxl jefferson the virginian would be redeemed before the time when the notes had to be destroyed he was also charged with attempting to cover his transactions by set ting up a loan office henry without realizing the full implications of the proposal but scenting scandal attacked it boldly in the house of burgesses and uttered one exclamation which jefferson never forgot it had been urged said jefferson that from certain unhappy circumstances of the colony men of substantial property had con tracted debts which if exacted suddenly must ruin them and their families but with a little indulgence of time might be paid with ease then as he remembered patrick henry said what sir is it proposed then to reclaim the spendthrift from his dissipation and extravagance by filling his pockets with money the proposal was killed by the council not by the burgesses as jefferson recalled and his memory may have been otherwise at fault again he said that henry was supported by the members from the upper counties and that only an aristocratic minority was opposed after the death of robinson in his private loans from public funds were discovered and insofar as proved necessary these were charged against his estate the names of his beneficiaries were not re vealed though some prominent planters have been strongly suspected the fact that colonel peter randolph and edmund pendleton were among the executors of robinsons will need not imply that they were personally involved but it does suggest where their political sympa thies lay the immediate result was the separation of the offices of speaker and treasurer as fauquier had advised peyton randolph assuming the one and robert carter nicholas the other both of these older men were in office when jefferson entered public life and he never ques tioned their complete integrity patrick henry was now established as a man of prominence but he did not dominate the scene in policy though not in social intercourse jefferson was to be more closely identi fied with him and with richard henry lee than with the stillpowerful remnants of the old ruling group not until afterwards did he speak disparagingly of the aristocracy or even condemn extravagance and debt but by this early date some seeds of doubt had fallen into his retentive mind in

journals p xxi ford dc w w henry pat rick henry i j listening at the capitol soon afterwards he and mercer walked side by side through the thickest of the people there were some little murmurs but they were not molested mercer shortly resigned and perhaps the honors were no more than even but fauquier had maintained public order and his own prestige there was no such violence here as there had been a few weeks earlier in boston where the house of lieutenant governor thomas hutchin son was destroyed and his valuable books and papers were scattered in the street mobs could not be assembled so readily in this agricultural province as in a seaport city and leadership here was retained by the genteel group also until lord dunmore appeared on the eve of the revolution the province of virginia was fortunate in its governors fauquier and his immediate successor lord botetourt were more tactful and judicious than sir francis bernard and thomas hutchin son it was not from them that young jefferson gained the low impres sion that he afterwards held of the manners of british officials so far as imperial relations were concerned from the time of the struggle over the stamp act onward he was more impressed with the agreement of the political leaders of virginia than by their differences of opinion he always credited patrick henry with giving the first impulse to the ball of revolution there and in all his later statements he manifested his own sympathy with him and the bolder spirits in cluding the lees he believed that a new political alignment was cre ated as a result of the increased prominence of this group factional rivalries probably played a considerable part in these early struggles the change was symbolized by the discrediting of speaker john rob inson who was also treasurer of the colony and the central figure among the dominant leaders when he passed from the political scene in the year before jefferson was admitted to the bar and three years before he became a burgess a new period began though at first the differences from the old one were not startling robinson was involved in dubious financial transactions which pat rick henry and richard henry lee suspected and which jefferson afterwards condemned though he was gentle towards the man himself in a time of financial difficulty following the french and indian war robinson as treasurer had reemitted redeemed treasury notes and ac cepted the paper of various individuals in return expecting that this for an illuminating discussion of the political alignment in the prerevolu tdonary years

forever from the scene after a tedious ill ness which he bore with patience and fortitude fauquier died at the palace in march at the age of sixtyfive until the end he con tinued to be a friend to scientific inquiry for he prescribed in his will that if he should die from any disease of which the physicians did not know the cause his body might be opened also he strikingly re vealed his humanitarian spirit regretting that it would be necessary to sell his slaves he specifically enjoined that the women and children should not be separated that his former servants should be allowed to choose their own new masters and that they were then to be sold to those chosen masters at a considerable discount from the market price jefferson was not among the principal gentlemen who were pres ent when the unviolated body of fauquier was laid to rest in bruton church for he was then in albemarle planting his garden and pre paring to start out on a circuit of county courts but when he got to williamsburg a little later he undoubtedly heard full details from george wythe who was one of the executors of the late governors american estate as a subscriber to the virginia gazette also he could hardly have failed to read and approve the lines which soon appeared there if ever virtue lost a friend sincere if ever sorrow claimd virginias tear if ever death a noble conquest made twas when

he was twenty three he made a journey of about three months to annapolis phila delphia and new york returning to virginia by water this was his nearest approach to a grand tour such as young english gentlemen made at the close of their formal schooling he continued his prepara tions for the bar for several months longer and he never ceased to be a student but this trip besides being an educational experience in itself marked with some precision the end of his years of tutelage he made the trip alone though he had not expected to he had counted on the lively companionship of frank willis of gloucester county willis had played disconcerting practical jokes on him and john tyler when they were reading law in williamsburg such as overturning the table or carrying off their lawbooks but he found willis entertaining when he himself was not studying this waggish young man had to start earlier however and jefferson had no com pany but his own thoughts as he drove to annapolis in a onehorse chair on the way he was nearly spilled into a stream when fording it and had other minor misadventures the account of them which he sent john page shows that he was not wholly devoid of humor and his comments on the capital of maryland show that he was keeping his eyes open observing the lower house of the assembly in session he was sharply critical of its procedure

he must have concluded that the economy of maryland was much like that of virginia tobacco being the chief thing attended to in both of them he witnessed the celebration of the repeal of the stamp act and to him this was prob ably the first notable sign of the community of colonial interest as he drove onward through delaware and into pennsylvania he saw cultivated country which was very different from the tidewater of virginia and the heavily forested piedmont of his youth the land beyond newcastle was beautifully laid out in fields of clover grain and flax crops like these he afterwards encouraged in albemarle along with orchards like the luxuriant ones he now saw and he must have found this part of his journey wholly pleasing philadelphia could hardly have failed to arouse his wonderment there was no such city in virginia or anywhere else in the colonies for that matter it had between eighteen and twenty thousand people and it stretched for almost two miles along the delaware he probably noticed that the people were frugal and industrious and he may have observed as another did that they were not remarkably courteous and hospitable to strangers unless particularly recommended to them however he had at least one letter of introduction and he may have had more this had been given him by dr george gilmer nephew of his albemarle neighbor dr thomas walker who had recently returned from the university of edinburgh and was then living in williams burg it was addressed to dr john morgan who was already on the road to eminence in philadelphia gilmer had known morgan in edin burgh and was confident that his penetrating genius would soon dis cern that jefferson was a young gentleman eminently worthy of his acquaintance nothing was said here about the latters

of jeffer son suggests that by showing the latter some of his collection he may also have contributed to his education in the arts jefferson the virginian gave it whoever the officiating physician may have been the fact that jefferson was inoculated is noteworthy for this enables us to place him somewhat more precisely in the history of advancing science and to judge of the progress of his expanding mind agricultural virginia was relatively free from smallpox but the scourge had appeared there in his time the method of inoculation sometimes described as variolation had been introduced into the massachusetts bay colony in the first quarter of the century but in boston it had met with opposition which went to the extremes of mob violence and it had been officially prohibited in new york it had been only occasionally resorted to in virginia up to this time and the general belief there was that it served to spread rather than to prevent the disease the mortality from this crude form of inoculation was con siderable and a much better method jennerian vaccination was to come but young jefferson who made a point of divesting his mind of prejudice and of forming independent judgments decided to run the risk he appears to have suffered no ill effects from taking his stand with the medical pioneers and in his efforts to prevent this dread disease he remained for a generation in the vanguard another and less significant detail of information about his first trip outside of his own region has been preserved in new york he chanced to take lodgings at the same place with elbridge gerry of massachusetts then four years out of harvard they were to meet again in the continental congress and to be associated in the bitter partisan struggles of still later years against the federalists at this time however no one would have been likely to think of jefferson as an embryonic politician in the sense that we use the term today it would have been agreed by competent observers that he was ad mirably prepared to assume the public role which was traditional in his class but this did not necessarily involve agitation or political family tradition in randall

points out that jefferson was in error about the exact year disciple of enlightenment manipulation and to those who knew him best he must have seemed most distinctive in the diversity of his interests and the universality of his spirit he had not traveled far as yet but he was already a citizen of the world in his own mind and he placed his trust not in temporal powers but in liberated intelligence there is no certain way of knowing just when this apostle of freedom first swore eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man but there can be no doubt that by this time he was bold as well as active in pursuit of knowledge there is little question that before he stepped on the public stage he had arrived at his abiding conviction that human intelligence can unlock not only the treasure house of the past but also the secrets of the universe thus leading mankind onward to a richer and better life and that he per sonally was proceeding on that assumption he did not need to express in so many words his belief in the mind until somebody combatted it or until it appeared that some obstacle to its freedom must be overthrown this faith was so essential a part of his own spiritual nature and of the framework of ideas within which he operated that he generally took it for granted it was in the air that his spirit breathed it was a major element in the intellectual climate in which he chose to dwell that climate was not virginian though many of his countrymen basked in its warmth as he did it was not american though it prevailed in important quarters on this continent while he was growing up so far as he was concerned it was chiefly english in its origins but it had become international it was the cli mate of opinion or the cluster of ideas or the pattern of thought which is commonly described as the enlightenment if we must date the great intellectual revolution of which he so gladly made himself an heir it began with sir isaac newton and john locke whom he included with lord bacon in his trinity of immortals it had spread through widening circles of select spirits in england and on the continent and by the middle of the eighteenth century it was well represented among the colonial intelligentsia most notably by benjamin franklin to whom he was a successor in more ways than one jefferson did not introduce the enlightenment into the colonies his famous saying i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man was in a letter to benja min rush sept on the enlightenment in general see preserved smith history of modem culture ii esp ch on its earlier american manifestations see m curti growth of american thought ch to benjamin rush jan ford ix jefferson the virginian but he became its almost perfect embodiment and after franklin its most conspicuous apostle on his side of the atlantic to its major tenets he always clung among the most important of these was the belief that the mind of man had emerged from shackles and darkness and had launched itself upon a limitless career of intel lectual conquest by accepting this he by no means severed all links with the past but he did become preeminently forwardlooking like his kindred spirits he adopted certain confident hypotheses about universal natural law and natural rights and with these an attitude of hostility to arbitrary power of any sort a belief in the vast un provability if not the perfectibility of man and an impulse toward humanitarianism to jefferson this was not a body of cold doctrine but of liberal and expanded thought it was a warm and moving gospel the full implications of this living faith will appear only in the unfolding of his story but since he had to become a disciple before he could stand forth as an apostle a question which may already have been answered in general terms should now be raised specifically how did the influence of the enlightenment reach him in the forests of virginia the chief personal impact upon his receptive mind came from the williamsburg trio small fauquier and wythe they an ticipated the greater trinity of newton locke and bacon william small acquainted him more familiarly with sir isaac new ton and opened before his eyes the vistas of an ordered universe this mathematician and natural philosopher may not have talked often with his eager pupil about the dignity of human nature since he doubtless assumed it but first among jeffersons teachers he showed him what the mind can do francis fauquier who kept charts of the temperature discussed philosophical matters at his generous table and provided so solicitously for the future of his slaves represented the enlightenment in its humanitarian as well as its scientific aspects george wythe as a classicist belonged more to the past than either of the others but the study of the greek and latin masters had served to enrich and liberalize his mind not to enslave it and throughout life he was notably humane it may be assumed that he and both the other men were fa m i l i ar with john locke whose general ideas were so well known at this time and in this place that they might almost be taken for granted along with those of newton young jefferson however for ties between the philosophers and the past see carl becker heavenly city of the eighteenthcentury philosophers pp and elsewhere fur ther reference to jeffersons own familiarity with locke is made in ch xhl disciple of enlightenment was now less interested in political theory than he was in general learn ing and he appears not inappropriately to have made obeisance to bacon first before he set out for annapolis he had in his possession at least one of bacons books jefferson eventually followed the path of free inquiry further than any of his local contemporaries and he gathered richer fruits as he went along but the general spirit of the leaders among his countrymen was not uncongenial with his own at a later time he found some of the large planters conservative in political and economic questions as guardians of their own interests but the greatest of them were men of large affairs in touch with the european world and affected by its major currents of thought the anglican clergy may have lacked spirituality as the evangelicals claimed and unquestionably they struggled to maintain their special privileges but they were not other worldly and there were strong traces of rationalism among them if his contemporaries wondered about young jefferson in these and the next few years it was not so much because of the way he was going as because they questioned the wisdom of anybodys going so far the zest with which he embarked on intellectual pursuits was similar to that shown by other enlightened spirits but it was manifested by him to such a marked degree as to be characteristically individual the habits of unremitting study which he had formed by his college days and which he ever afterwards maintained are not to be thought of pri marily as the expression of a stern sense of duty no calvinist in new england could have been more rigorous in selfdiscipline than he was but the supremely significant fact about his lifelong quest of knowledge is that he found in it infinite delight he always loved to study for by this means he expanded the horizons of his mind and gained the power of knowledge which was the only power he really craved jefferson had begun to visit the office of the virginia gazette in williamsburg and to buy books there during his years as a law student at a later time not even he could have read all the volumes in his library but he probably read everything he bought in these years on oct he had a copy of bacons philosophy bound as shown by the day books of the v a gazette in the possession of prof j s wilson of the university of virginia entries from the day books show numerous purchases by jeffer son these are reproduced in william peden thomas

fugitive early book lists assume disproportionate im portance still more can be learned about his early tastes from the notebooks he kept into these he copied extracts from the authors he read and together with a few surviving letters from his young man hood and scattered references in later writings they provide the best available clues to his early thought the notebook which has been termed his literary bible and which he began to keep when he was about twentyone is particularly valuable the classical writers engaged him most at first despite the impulse toward natural philosophy which william small gave him they con stituted a rich source of delight to him throughout life and were the chosen companions of his old age from his days in maurys school latin was a ready instrument and he found this language most useful in making himself a scholar in the law as for greek he read homer in popes translation to begin with then under the inspiration of wythe he turned to the original which he ever afterwards preferred he read euripides at this time but apparently not aeschylus he never cared for plato and with aristotle he seems not to have concerned himself at all he was acquainted with the latin poets especially virgil and he valued the maxims of seneca and the republican moralities of cicero like most other people he was more imaginative in his early years than he was afterwards he was sensitive to the niceties of words as well as to natural beauty and at this stage he was fond of english poetry he read a great deal of it but in this field he appears to have been relatively conventional and easily pleased he bought the works of milton before he was twentyone and he copied numerous extracts from him in his notebook including diatribes against women from paradise lost he afterwards recommended to the young that they read the best of the poets and he himself was familiar with the older masters and almost the whole of the eighteenthcentury group for a time he kept up with literary fashion and his knowledge of english verse was more than superficial but he never regarded himself as a man of happy imagination and poetic fancy he read more for profit than pleasure and he sought no avenue of escape from life he was familiar with shakespeare from an early time valuing him gilbert chinard edited this as the literary bible of thomas jefferson his

favorite among the writers in this field was laurence sterne whom he long chuckled over in jefferson himself however little humor had appeared as yet except in the form of elaborate ex aggeration he was particularly fond of history but his interest in this subject was probably greatest after he became a public man like other disciples of the enlightenment he was aware of the value of modem languages he had employed french from the beginning of his study of the law and he soon took up italian perhaps he was attracted to italian in the first place because it was the source of musical terms before long he also found that it had contributed richly to the language of architecture he had not yet tackled spanish and he said regretfully late in life that he never learned german he had a distinct flair for languages but modern literature meant little to him except in english shortly before the revolution when he discovered ossian he showed interest in celtic this was akin to his enduring interest in anglosaxon which began when he was struggling with legal terms as a law student he liked to trace words as well as legal and political institutions to their sources and even in his early man hood his spirit was that of a scholar rather than a literary man it is far more important to consider the predominant purposes of this omnivorous young man than it is to draw up a full menu of his reading for he only tasted some things while others he devoured his appetite never ceased to be gargantuan but even he had to make some selection and he did this not in the fastidious spirit of a gourmet but in the mood of an ambitious workman who wanted to build up his strength he greatly desired to make of himself a cultivated person he did not scorn the traditional embellishments of genteel life and he loved learning and the arts for their own sake but as one who lived in a new and undeveloped country he was most anxious to acquire randall i va gazette day books entry of feb showed the purchase of italian books including a dictionary to peter birkman may lc a german song with interlined english translation in his writing at uva is printed in m kim ball road

croft oct l b xv ill his wellknown essay on anglosaxon follows pp jefferson the virginian knowledge that was useful to man he regarded the human mind not as a toy to be played with but as an instrument to be used in the cause of progress by the time that he assumed a full share of the business of life his own mind was unusually well equipped for the accomplishment of practical purposes as broadly conceived also it was thoroughly eman cipated as he properly believed it had to be before it could be fully employed we might be tempted to believe that this lifelong champion of liberty was bom into intellectual freedom in some ideal state of nature no one was more aware than he however that customs tradi tions and imperfect human institutions impose shackles on the mind and he himself must have had to throw off some of these the records of his inner life in this important period are distressingly incomplete but they bear traces of struggle and strongly suggest that this struggle was primarily in the sphere of religion and morals it is a fair assump tion that the first major obstacle to the freedom of the mind which he clearly perceived was the doctrine of supernatural revelation and that after he had rid himself of this the major intellectual problem of his young manhood was that of finding adequate moral sanction else where his general manner in regard to religious questions throughout life was one of reticence since he regarded these as a private concern he wrote and talked about them very little as he did about intimate personal matters of other sorts he has left no diaries comparable with those of the adamses wherein he revealed his secret and sacred reflec tions but he did keep notebooks of his reading and his literary bible is specially valuable in providing clues to his nonpolitical thought one cannot be sure of course that he accepted all the sentiments of homer euripides and cicero of shakespeare milton and boling broke that he copied or that a unified philosophy could be fabricated from all these fragments in certain cases however later comments and actions show the quotations to have been extraordinarily apt thus he copied this sentence from lord bolingbroke no hypothesis ought to be maintained if a single phenomenon stands in direct opposition to it whether or not under the inspiration of fauquier he learned from this english writer to apply to the bible and theology the same tests as to secular history and scientific hypotheses the acceptability of this dictum to him is obvious in the light of what he said later urging his nephew peter carr to apply critical tests to the new testament literary bible p see penetrating comments of chinard ibid pp and ch in the valuable study of adri enne koch philosophy of thomas jeffers cm disciple of enlightenment he wrote your own reason is the only oracle given to you by heaven and you are answerable not for the rightness but uprightness of the decision he certainly did not regard the intelligence of any single human being as infallible but he saw no escape from the obliga tion to employ the mind fearlessly in every field he concerned himself much in his twenties with the mysteries of death and immortality in the year that he became president of the united states replying to a communication about the transmigration of souls he had this to say about the country of spirits when i was young i was fond of the speculations which seemed to promise some insight into that hidden country but observing at length that they left me in the same ignorance in which they had found me i have for very many years ceased to read or to think concerning them and have reposed my head on that pillow of ignorance which a benevolent creator has made so soft for us knowing how much we should be forced to use it during his inquiring youth and young manhood he did not find the answers and characteristically he addressed himself to the problems of this world which reason can better understand on the other hand he did find noble and inspiriting maxims and examples not in the christian scriptures which he undervalued at this stage but primarily in the writings of classical antiquity and out of these he evolved a working philosophy he attached himself to no school of shallow opti mism in extract after extract one can perceive the mood of disenchant ment as in this one from popes iliad to labour is the lot of man below and when jove gave us life he gave us woe he learned from the greek poets not to expect too much from life not to dream of a chimerical bliss but to do his duty without expecting to be rewarded to cultivate his friends and love his country even to the point of self sacrifice from ancient writers he learned the possibility of courageous resignation and under their in spiration he worked out for himself a program which was little short of the heroic allowance must be made for the period in his life when he recorded these somber reflections melancholy was not characteristic of jefferson bt aug l b vi to rev isaac story dec ford viii literary bible p chinard ibid p jefferson the virginian in his ripe maturity his temperament was then notably sanguine the extracts which he copied marked an early and passing phase he had a disappointing love affair in his early twenties and soon afterwards lost a favorite sister he was not wholly at ease in social relationships as a young man and not until after his own marriage did he find himself as a domestic being it was at the beginning of this period of imperfect personal adjustment that he wrote to john page about bearing up with a tolerable degree of patience under this burden of life of proceeding with a pious and unshaken resignation and of arriving at such a philosophy that few things could disturb him at all and nothing could disturb him much before he attained domestic happiness he had probably worked out his enduring philosophy of life it was marked by cheerfulness not gloom and he afterwards described it as epicurean though he hastened to say that the term was much misunderstood he came to believe that happiness was the end of life but as has been said he was engaged by the peculiar conjunction of duty with happiness and his working philosophy was a sort of blend of epicureanism and stoicism in which the god of happiness was attained by selfdiscipline at no time after he became mature did he emphasize mere amusement or pleasure for its own sake this was true in the arts as well as in literature thus he appears as an exceedingly serious young man who had worked things out in his own mind just about as far as he thought they could be worked out by him and who had freed himself entirely from the need of a churchly sanction he was not wholly a rationalist however and he did feel the need for some sort of authority which he was unwilling to concede to church or priest this he found within an individuals own breast in the conscience which he regarded as a spe cial moral sense as truly a part of mans nature as his sense of sight or hearing his arm or his leg how early he reached this opinion it is difficult to say he may have groped for a time in a dim borderland of ethical uncertainty but he had definitely emerged from it before he wrote the earliest of his notable public papers for these are marked by a burning consciousness of moral values addressing king george iii in he said the great principles of right and wrong are legible to every reader to pursue them requires not the aid of many coun sellors the issues of his time do not now seem that simple but it is highly significant that he saw them not merely as political and eco july ford i koch p and ch passim taking issue with chinard in literary bible pp jefferson to william short oct ford x to peter carr aug ford tv good discussion in koch ch in his summary view ford i disciple of enlightenment nomic but as moral issues and that they aroused his righteous indig nation he was certainly not immoral though some lapses might have been expected when he was young and after the period of youthful doubt it would be improper to term him irreligious as has been well said he was a pious man if the religion of a humane morality is recognized as a kind of natural piety but unquestionably he was secular in these years and he probably would not have called himself a christian at some time before the american revolution he copied the dictum of bolingbroke that the teachings of christ comprise an incomplete body of ethics and that a system collected from the writings of the ancient heathen moralists would be more full more entire more coherent and more clearly deduced from unquestionable principles of knowledge young jefferson may not have wholly agreed with the english writer at this stage and in the ripeness of years he found in the teachings of jesus the purest system of morals ever before preached to man eventually he regarded the heathen moralists as insuffi cient even in his old age however he was fully convinced that the priests protestant as well as catholic had adulterated and sophisti cated the teachings of jesus for their own selfish purposes and from his twenties until his death he was anticlerical in varying degrees of bitterness he served for a time as a vestryman in his parish as a leading planter was supposed to do he continued throughout life to have warm personal friends among the enlightened clergy and he always con tributed generously to local churches but before he attacked the special privileges of the establishment in virginia ecclesiastical authority and traditional theology had wholly ceased to have validity for him the right to complete intellectual and religious freedom which he after wards championed so conspicuously for all men he had already claimed for himself koch p literary bible p to s kercheval jan l b xii the young lawyer j efferson began to practise law before he reached the age of twentyfour and he continued to do so for seven years the five years since he finished college had not been employed solely in prepa ration for his profession he was deliberately fitting himself for the whole of life as he expected to live it but he had studied law with the utmost seriousness and considering the time he had spent his profes sional career was short in the light of the generation of conspicuous public service which followed his legal career itself may be regarded as a period of further preparation and an exceedingly important one at the time however the impressive facts were that he threw himself into his profession with characteristic vigor and quickly achieved an honored position in it from the beginning he was probably more interested in the study of law than in practice but if he rebelled against the drudgery incident to his calling he did not do so because of any repugnance for details the main reason for his early abandonment of law was not that he disliked it nor that he preferred the political arena he never hated anything connected with it quite as much as he loathed the contro versies and recriminations which afterwards befell him as a public man his practice of law was a constituent part of the business of life until the courts were closed shortly before the outbreak of the american revolution and it was the central part up to the time of his marriage he never disliked practical affairs in themselves he always attended to them industriously and systematically and he complained about them only when they interfered unduly with more delightful things such as the enrichment of the mind and the eniovment of domestic life he jefferson the virginian had little reason to complain of undue interference before his marriage thus he appeared in his first years at the bar as a man of business apart from the interest which inheres in most of his activities small or large and private as well as public this period is of particular signifi cance in revealing his habits as a man of affairs and the degree of his practical effectiveness before he mounted his horse to ride to court he had already entered upon the business of life to some extent the year that he attained his majority and came into his inheritance he had ceased charging the expenses of his education against his fathers estate and had nominally assumed the headship of the family also he had had to choose be tween the rivanna and the fluvanna lands which peter jefferson had left to him and his young brother on this subject there was probably no question in his mind at any time he succeeded to the lands on which his father had lived and immediately assumed a position of dignity and responsibility in that part of the county the rivanna estate comprised about half and much the more impor tant part of his total inheritance of somewhat more than five thousand acres the family seat at shadwell with its four hundred acres did not actually belong to him until after his mothers death in the year of the declaration of independence considerably before that time he built for himself a house on the forested hill across the way but until he continued to live at shadwell from the age of twentytwo also he rented from his mother the farm there with the slaves who were on it he had twenty slaves or more in his own right but these were otherwise employed the gristmill which his father had built was already his it stood on the north bank of the little river and the water which turned its wheels was brought by a canal from a dam half a mile above it it was a profitable piece of property until it was swept away with its house and dam in die great fresh of he was not yet devoting himself much to agriculture though he had assumed the necessary financial responsibilities and had begun to keep his garden book the first entry in this made in clear hand on march has a more poetic flavor than he probably realized when he recorded the simple fact that the purple hyacinth had begun to bloom all

ground and wild honeysuckle in the woods thus he appears first as an observer of the pleasant phenomena of nature by the time that he became a lawyer however he had become more utilitarian that year he sowed peas henceforth he continued to record plantings of flowers and vegetables shrubs and trees but he had not started his farm book as yet it is impossible to believe that he was ever indifferent to the crops of tobacco and com on his red fields but during his years as a bachelor he left his farms pretty much as they were probably com mitting the details of management to a single steward or overseer with one matter which directly affected him as an albemarle planter however and which was also of considerable public interest he actively concerned himself from the time that he was grown his efforts to improve the navigation of the stream which flowed through his lands antedated his services in the house of burgesses and even his practice of law to the best of his knowledge no hogsheads of tobacco had ever been transported on the north branch of the james to its junction with the larger stream about the time that he came of age however he learned that a canoe had recently been used on its lower waters taking a canoe himself he explored the only seriously obstructed sec tion and concluded that this could be made navigable to loaded boats merely by the removal of loose rock he then set on foot a subscription obtained two hundred pounds and interested his neighbor dr thomas walker who was a member of the house of burgesses it was in october that an act of assembly was passed for clearing the great falls of james river the river chickahominy and the north branch of james river the legislative act merely authorized a laudable and useful undertaking which was to be effected by private means three groups of trustees were set up to receive subscriptions and to make the necessary contracts in the group assigned to the north branch rivanna was young jefferson along with other prominent gentlemen of the county with almost every person named on the other lists he was afterwards associated in public or private life this appointment therefore constituted the first official sign of his identi fication with the leaders of the county and province locally he was the initiator of the project and probably the most active member of the group the work of clearing away the obstructions appears to have been finished by the time of his marriage and for a generation afterwards the stream was used completely and fully he said for the carrying down of produce throughout the eighteenth century the navigable jefferson the virginian section began at milton falls a mile or two below shadwell so boats did not actually go past his mill but the short land haul was not much of an inconvenience to him years after he initiated this undertaking he took great pride in it shortly before he was elected president he asked himself whether his country was the better for his having lived at all then rather dubiously he drew up a list of things in which he had been the instrument beginning with this youthful effort to further the flow of agricultural commerce and following with the declaration of independence which was clearly second to it in point of time whether or not this was his most memorable action before the revolu tion as he himself believed it was his first piece of constructive public service in the year the family at shadwell besides thomas consisted of his mother and four other children jane randolph jefferson was now fortyseven several times a grandmother and an old lady by the standards of the time his younger sister elizabeth unmarried at twentythree was undoubtedly regarded as an old maid lucy now fifteen remained at home a couple of years longer then she married charles lilburne lewis who was also descended from isham randolph besides her there were the twins anna scott and randolph who were twelve peter jeffersons thoughtful provisions for the maintenance of the younger children and for the portions of the girls had been rigorously carried out and continued to be enough of the financial records of the family have survived to show that a good deal of bookkeeping was required and that the elder son assumed much of the burden of this after he grew up a decade before he became important as a draftsman of state papers he showed that he was particularly good at keeping accounts and at any sort of paper work in which diligence accuracy and neatness were required he not only made a record of the agree ment with his mother whereby he hired five of her shadwell hands at six pounds each per annum he also kept vouchers for the sides of pork the quarters of beef and the bushels of com that he furnished her for his unmarried and not wholly responsible sister elizabeth he began to keep a special account as soon as she was grown though his inability the young lawyer to prevent her from mixing her charges with his own at a store in rich mond caused it to become sadly confused there are no surviving letters from this period to illustrate the generosity and affection which he so consistently manifested towards all of his close relations but his scrupulous exactitude in keeping the financial records of the family was manifested from the first life in the plantation village of shadwell was doubtless hospitable generous and friendly as it so generally was in that clime and region and as it always was afterwards at monticello and jefferson himself was far from parsimonious but he did like to put everything down in black and white the major personal records as distinguished from letters which remain and which serve to illuminate so many of the details of his own life had their beginning in this period they are wholly objective in form but they are fascinating documents of their kind and are of great importance to anyone who would understand him the garden book which he started in and kept more or less continuously for upwards of half a century contains a much greater variety of items than its title would imply and reveals from the outset the utilitarian cast of his ingenious mind in it he noted that it would take peas of the sort he was planting to fill a pint measure that a horse would generally eat or bundles of fodder in a night and during an albemarle winter that hills would yield cucumbers in a season some random bits of horticultural lore he copied out of books but he gained more from his own observations or from friends or neighbors who told him something of interest which he promptly put down to these he added after he became a builder all sorts of miscellaneous calculations about bricks mortar wheelbarrows and the like this is no diary of esthetic rapture it is a systematic though frag mentary factual record which served a useful purpose to a practical man the account books as they are commonly called which he kept in unending series until the week before he died are distinctly informal during his years as a practitioner he listed law cases here as in a day book and when he had finished with them or transferred them to a more permanent record he scratched them off he recorded here the most trivial items of cash expenditure the first entries made in the summer of show him attending court across the mountains in these accounts are in his fee book huntington lib uva photostat in their present form they may date from after the fire at shadwell these invaluable records are in several repositories as is shown in the bibli ography attached to this work a complete set in photostat is at uva refer ence to them hereafter will be by date only jefferson the virginian staunton he paid a shilling to a washing woman and gave a blacksmith five shillings for shoeing his horse thenceforth wherever he went he carried the memorandum book for that year with him jotting down at night all the expenditures that he remembered and adding other items of interesting information which he had recently acquired con sidering the circumstances the entries are remarkably clear and under standable they rarely record impressions but they have made it possible to chart his daily movements to a degree which is rarely possible in the lives of even the most notable of men in another book he began to keep a formal record of his important cases and he also had a fee book which served as a ledger and con tained various accounts these records made with more careful hand than the daily memoranda were would delight the most critical of eyes he listed his cases by dates and number separating them by neatly drawn lines and leaving space for filling in the story of later develop ments after the lapse of more than a century and a half the writing is clear as crystal had he been so disposed he could have easily pre pared a copybook for his sisters children from this beautifully kept record we learn that on february he got a client in the person of gabriel jones of augusta county and entered caveat in his behalf for one hundred acres of land near warm spring about six weeks later he received three pounds from jones though the case continued into another year he was long to know this eccentric lawyer of the shenandoah valley at first as a friend and later as a political foe and he had much early business from this county just beyond the blue ridge that was where the west began later he said with only slight inaccuracy that staunton was the farthest he ever went in that direction this outlying county seat was then small and crude that summer he took a case there for john madison father of his young friend james of maurys school and for long years the county clerk the tradition is that john madison did him the honors of the place at the beginning of his legal career taking him at length to a loft where a party were playing cards by torchlight madison who had a powder horn beneath his coat dropped powder behind each man and trailed it out the door then just as an unlucky player was invoking the devil he fired the train and caused the gamesters to rush headlong from the accursed place this is probably the first story that jefferson ever told huntington lib photostats at uva referred to hereafter as case book and fee book the young lawyer about riding the circuit it is a pity that he did not tell more but he was no abraham lincoln his business in the county courts was extensive he had cases in forty or more of them before he got through unlike patrick henry how ever he did not lay the foundations of his legal reputation in this country practice no stories survive about his participation in dramatic trials such as the parsons cause and he gained no particular reputation as a jury lawyer in that field patrick henry was the greatest of his generation in virginia and after his death many doubted if he would ever be excelled even in henrys case much of the country practice was routine business such as bringing actions of debt and his system atic young friend from albemarle was unquestionably his superior as a draftsman of legal papers and was more diligent in matters of detail the county courts were informal and the more important trials did not occur in them family tribunals they have been called at a later time jefferson spoke of the procedure in albemarle as slovenly and his careful study of english cases could have availed him little there the few surviving comments from his contemporaries about his abilities as a speaker give the impression that during his young manhood these were greater than has been commonly supposed edmund randolph said that he spoke with ease perspicuity and elegance though his style was less impassioned than in his writing it was impossible for him to bellow if he raised his voice it soon grew husky no gathering that he attended in those years was ever very large but even in a small informal courtroom he could not hope to match patrick henry by appealing to the emotions of jurymen the county court was a notable institution in virginia both in its judicial and executive aspects its magistrates were not jurists as in his fathers and grandfathers day they were the leading citizens of the various districts personal acquaintance with such men was of great importance to anyone who would play an important part in provincial affairs and making a round of the counties constituted a political educa tion in itself jefferson went regularly to those that were near his own and he came to know somebody in practically every one of them he said it is doubtful if ever during his entire career he had such a wide personal acquaintance in virginia as he did before the revolution when memoirs of t j randolph pp edgehill

of all sorts were held on such occasions the studi ous young lawyer rubbed elbows with ordinary citizens to a greater extent than he ever did afterwards he gained for himself no such personal following as patrick henry did but he made innumerable acquaintances and gained an insight into the thoughts of common men which could not be got from books both by training and temperament he was better fitted for practice before the general court to which george wythe introduced him early in this first year not even this tribunal was composed of judges who were learned in the law it was made up of the members of the council chosen for wealth and standing without regard to legal knowl edge as he himself said their decisions could never be quoted either as adding to or detracting from the weight of those of the english courts on the same points during his last years as a law student and his early years as a practitioner accordingly he had made careful study of cases in the courts of kings bench and common pleas the domestic judgments of the general court were authoritative whether formed on sound legal principles or not such cases of domestic character as had been reported therefore he studied and abstracted with care these he found in certain manuscript volumes that were in the possession of his violinplaying friend john randolph the attorney general the record covered only the decade from to and there were no more reports thereafter until when he himself began to commit to writing some of the leading cases of the day in the midst of his own practice he served as a selfappointed reporter and as such was a pioneer whatever may be said about the prominent gentlemen who served as lay judges the virginia bar at this time contained men of high pro fessional competence wythe was probably the most learned member almost too learned some people thought he had dwelt so long with the ancient writers that it was hard for him to keep from giving a line from horace the force of an act of assembly edmund pendleton had had less time for literature but he was probably more effective as a lawyer though a most amiable man in personal relationships he was

not above baiting jeffersons guileless teacher upsetting his equanimity and thus robbing him of his strength the star of thomson mason who was comparable with george wythe in legal erudition had risen and john randolph who had succeeded his brother as kings attorney was an uncommonly able man he suffered by comparison with the relative newcomer patrick henry however when they locked horns in criminal cases which were the latters special forte during this period the orator is reported to have worn a black suit and tiewig when he appeared in the general court to the considerable improve ment of his appearance jefferson acted with him on certain occasions proving himself to be no master of overwhelming eloquence but an impressive speaker as long as his voice held out when they appeared together each of the men characterized himself so edmund randolph said mr jefferson drew copiously from the depths of the law mr henry from the recesses of the human heart two of the arguments which jefferson used in actual cases have been preserved in the reports which he made and which were published after his death he may have selected these chiefly because of the questions they dealt with for one had to do with slavery and the other with the clergy about two years after he began to practise he took without fee the case of one samuel howell the latters grandmother was a mulatto begotten of a white woman by a negro man and bound by the law to serve until the age of thirtyone during her servitude she was delivered of howells mother and the latter during her own servitude was delivered of howell this third mulatto was suing for freedom from the master to whom he had been sold and who claimed his services until he was thirtyone jeffersons scholarly argument was doomed from the outset and the court did not even wait to hear that of the equally humane wythe on the other side jeffersons contention was that one act had made a servant of the first mulatto and that a later one had extended it to her children but that it remained for some future legislature if any should be found wicked enough to extend it to grandchildren and other issue more remote the language of his peroration must have been startling especially when coupled with an wirt patrick henry p henry patrick henry i va mag xliii howell vs netherland apr godwin et al vs lunan oct these can

changed jefferson the virginian earlier reference of his to the law of nature under that law he said we are all bom free that he had come to such a philosophical position by the time this case was adjudged in is a significant item in the history of his thought but such an assertion carried no weight with a practicalminded court in a slaveowning society in the other reported case he represented the churchwardens and vestrymen of a parish in nansemond county in an action whereby they sought to oust an unworthy clergyman named patrick lunan the latter was accused of profane swearing drunkenness and adultery he was said to have declared that he cared not what religion he pro fessed so long as he got his pay in tobacco and also to have exposed his private parts to public view the main question was whether or not the right of visitation and deprivation resided in the court and by means of an elaborate historical treatise jefferson undertook to prove that it did reside in the court as representing the king his contention was upheld in october and he got a fivepound fee but the case was still awaiting adjudication three years later when he retired from practice he had upheld the power of the provincial court over the clergy but at a later time he would not have conceded so much to the prerogative of the king judging from the number of his cases jefferson had a substantial legal business in the seven years of his practice he listed nearly a thou sand in his formal record the fact that robert carter nicholas wanted to turn over his business to him in is indicative of his standing while the further fact that he declined to take it except for a very few cases which he finished shows that he already had just about as much as he could do his clients at one time or another included members of most of the leading families of the province randolphs and pages carys and harrisons nelsons and lees carters and byrds in the second year of his practice he recorded in his case book apparently with pride the honble wm byrd retains me generally his cases dealt with land ownership debts the recovery of slaves slander assault and battery he rendered

slander for saying he saw the pi who is a married man in bed with elizabeth burkin etc dis missed at plaintiffs request whether or not this business was profitable depends on the criteria that are applied the statement of jeffersons executor that his average profits as expressed in dollars were about a year has often been quoted for those days that sum would have represented a handsome addition to the living and income that he got from his landed estate in this generous estimate however the word profits is loosely used to designate the sums that were due him never did the fees that he charged aggregate much more than a year and they generally amounted to less furthermore he never succeeded in collecting as much as per cent his legal business reached its greatest volume in and in that year he managed to collect of the amount that was due him it is doubtful if he had any more trouble with collections than other lawyers did difficulties of this sort were general and notorious the year that he was admitted to the bar another lawyer announced that the backwardness of his clients in paying him would have obliged him to quit his practice had he been impelled by no other reason john mercer had appointed a receiver but the latter out of had not yet been able to collect enough to cover his own wage and mercers randall i a summary of his receipts fees due and total business for the years is in account book for from other records it appears that his business declined somewhat thereafter jefferson the virginian taxes accordingly the unfortunate lawyer now felt compelled to sue the situation was so serious that in may jefferson pendleton john randolph patrick henry and two other lawyers inserted a notice in the gazette they announced that it would not be possible for them to continue their practice in the general court on the same terms as heretofore even if the fees allowed by law were regularly paid they said these would barely compensate them for their incessant labors or reimburse their expenses and the losses incurred by the neglect of their private affairs yet even these confessedly moderate rewards were withheld in large proportion by the unworthy part of their clients accordingly they announced that after a specified date in the fall they would require full payment before rendering an opinion and would not prosecute or defend a case unless they received the tax in advance and half the fee by that time jefferson had already found it necessary to give more of his time to his personal affairs and in the year following this announcement he wholly retired from practice in his years as a bachelor that is until he was nearing twentynine and had been almost five years at the bar absence from home disturbed him much less than it did after he had a family of his own and un questionably his journeys imparted increased interest to his life on his way to the county courts and to williamsburg he generally went on horseback or in a onehorse chair his servant jupiter who was just his age as a rule went with him or followed close behind possibly carrying his luggage in a cart the name of this trusted companion of the road who had been going with him since his days as a law student recurs in his account books with regularity jefferson was always giving money to jupiter to pay a saddler in staunton to pay for ferriages to williamsburg and for bread and candles there he even borrowed small coin from jupiter at times when he himself ran out he and his slave did not keep house both in the county seats and in the provincial capital he stayed generally in such lodgings as the times afforded though en route he frequently stopped with relatives or friends such as the carrs and thomas mann randolph whom the slaves called tuckahoe tom his visits to williamsburg coincided with the court sessions and thus fell in the most crowded times when the regular residents had too many guests in the second year of his practice if we may judge by the size of his various bills he lodged at charltons on the broad duke of gloucester street and took many rind va gazette feb may reproduced in ford i details from account books the yoxjng lawyer meals at the raleigh tavern across the way going to the coffee house beyond the capitol frequently for food and liquid entertainment and occasionally to ayscoughs and mrs vobes if the gaming in these places was as constant as has been reported the clatter of the diceboxes must have been trying to one who prized tranquillity so much he made many visits to john page at rosewell riding or driving to york then ferrying to gloucester at the home of this friend he fiddled and talked in company which was often if not always mixed it was a pleasant life and as a young gentleman who bought for himself not only books and fiddlestrings but also broad cloth silk hose and buckskin gloves he played his conventional part in it he continued to indulge in idle social chatter when he wrote to page but it was not in his nature to be silly for very long the playhouse in williamsburg had several good seasons during his early years as a lawyer the virginia company of comedians which came there in may not have been the equal of the london com pany of the elder lewis hallam which had visited the capital in his boyhood or of the american company of david douglas which had appeared there when he was in college but it put on a considerable number of plays that spring and when he was there he rarely missed one among these were addisons the drummer the merchant of venice otways venice preserved and the orphan and the beggars opera with peter pelham conducting the orchestra farces were often added to the main attraction and the spirit of the company was as comic as its name implied there were no other regular theatrical perform ances until the spring of and before the gaieties of that season were in swing a disturbing event had occurred on the banks of the rivanna and had been reported in williamsburg on february this item appeared in the virginia gazette we hear from albemarle that about a fortnight ago the house of thomas jefferson esq in that county was burnt to the ground together with all his furniture books papers c by which that gentleman sustains a very great loss he was from home when the accident occurred to be exact the conflagration occurred on february jefferson had dined with the family probably about two oclock and had then gone to charlottesville on business he had his first news from a purdie dixon va gazette mar apr may purdie dixon memoirs of t j randolph uva p jefferson the virginian servant who was dispatched after him and who undoubtedly reported that no lives were lost the tradition is that he immediately asked if they had saved his books and that the slave replied no master all lost but we save your fiddle presumably this was the instrument he had bought for five pounds in williamsburg the year before actually a few books were saved along with two or three beds but little else for two or three years he had been planning to leave shadwell as soon as his building operations on the mountain would permit and work was sufficiently advanced at monticello for him to move there late in the following november to endure the rigors of winter in a single room the other members of the family continued to live at shad well until after his mothers death probably making the best they could of the remaining buildings jefferson estimated at two hundred pounds sterling the value of his books that were burned but it was not the monetary loss that evoked his groans these were mainly law books which he could not immedi ately replace and with them were destroyed the notes which he had carefully prepared for his cases in the approaching general court these are gone he wrote page and like the baseless fabric of a vision leave not a trace behind unlike john marshall he did not learn through the ear but through the eye he was not one who could speak on the spur of the moment he put all important things down on paper and without notes he was lost he wondered therefore if it would not be possible for him to get a postponement of his cases be lieving that an exception might justly be made in such singular circum stances he managed to maintain a light tone of youthful banter in writing to this good friend but he could not conceal his deep concern his friends hastened to console and help him though page at the time had troubles of his own his wife had just lost her mother so he penned only a few hasty lines at york which the younger thomas nelson enclosed the latter promised to speed jeffersons order to the booksellers and assured him that his cases would be postponed the elder thomas nelson offered to make him a loan from his own collec tion and in the meantime sent hinges locks and pulleys doubtless think ing that these would be needed at monticello sooner than had been expected by sending him nectarines apricot grafts

difficulties but be the richer for his unfortunate experience soon thereafter page now more at leisure wrote him in sentimental vein it is probable that he did get a continuance of his cases or most of them at all events he managed to get through the busiest of his legal years he restored his books at the earliest possible time borrowing for this purpose one hundred pounds which dabney carr had lying idle though this sum alone was not enough within three years he had more volumes than he had lost his personal papers however were not replaceable and it is largely for this reason that the story of his life up to can never be told with such fullness as can that of his later years he himself said the letters of a person especially of one whose business has been chiefly transacted by letters form the only full and genuine journal of his life during his young manhood when he was fresh in the world of affairs he probably did not make copies of his letters so carefully as he did afterward but we would know con siderably more about him before he reached the age of twentyseven if the house at shadwell had not burned fortunately the loss was not so complete as he implied he said that he was destitute of papers of every kind whether public or private of business or amusement but he had preserved his memorandum account books and was thus enabled to draw up new records his garden book almost certainly was at monticello probably he had continued his boyish habit of reading on his hilltop and for that reason also kept his commonplace books there he has left a fairly full though largely an external story of his young manhood but it was not until after the fire that he became par excellence a keeper of records and began to accumulate documentary treasures such as have

account book for he noted that he had volumes to robert walsh apr uva account book c june m among the burgesses t he coming of a new royal governor to virginia about six months after fauquier died was an event of great interest in the province and it had important effects on the career of jefferson who was twentyfive years old at the time he was in williamsburg in late october when the right honorable norborne berkeley baron de botetourt arrived he was not among those who extended an official welcome to his lordship about sunset or who had supper with him afterwards at the raleigh tavern but he could hardly have failed to view the festive illumination of the city that night then it was that people of all ranks vied with each other in testifying their gratitude and joy that a nobleman of such distinguished merit and abilities had come to dwell among them though jefferson preferred fauquier who was not a lord and was technically only a deputy governor he was not yet suspicious of noblemen as such and like most other people he probably thought it a compliment that the british authorities had sent to the colony a resident governor general there were some people in virginia and more in england who ques tioned the wisdom of appointing this lord of the bedchamber who had suffered serious if not discreditable financial reverses but the description of botetourt by junius as a

life on the day after his arrival the new governor properlv dissolved the old assembly which was not then in session andvoon after that he issued writs for the election of a new one as a result of this action the freeholders of albemarle met in the courthouse in charlottesville before the middle of december and elected thomas jefferson as one of their two burgesses and in the month of alav he took his seat for the first time as a member of a legislative body during the next fifteen years he performed his public service primarily as a legislator the electors who chose him on this occasion were men possessing at least fifty unsettled acres or twentyfive if they had a p lant ation crl small house for the times the suffrage was liberal since that much land could be rather easily acquired the freeholders voted openly however and the opinions and preferences of the recognized leaders were generally determinative jeffersons friend dr thomas walker who had just returned from an important indian conference at fort stanwix was reelected the other burgess in the previous assembly had been edward carter whose holdings in the county considerably exceeded jeffersons and included carters mountain towering over monticello carter had failed to attend during the last session however and this fact probably was to his disadvantage it is impossible to determine now just how sharp the contest was but presumably there were no public issues the campaigning of that era which they called burgessing was wholly personal and consisted primarily of providing drinks and other refreshments

was modest however and it had the flavor of gentlemanly hospitality by nature jefferson was not good at electioneering or at mingling with a crowd his manners could never be harsh one of his friends observed but they were reserved towards the world at large it was fortunate for this future hero of the plain people that his career began in a period when influential gentlemen were at the helm the meeting at the court house was for him a sort of prelude to politics but it can be more aptly described as a genial introduction to public life at that time and place a man of his estate and training was expected to share the burden of public affairs and his ultimate election to the assembly might have been confidently expected without any special effort on his part normally he would have served first as a local magis trate and possibly he did a couple of years later he was a justice of the peace and member of the county court as his father had been and he may have begun this service before he attained the more responsible post of burgess at all events he quickly telescoped his fathers public career early initiation into public affairs was not uncommon in the province but his election at the age of twentyfive to a position which his father had attained only in the ripeness of years was a tribute to him never theless the leaders among the local gentry had undoubtedly perceived that peter jeffersons son was a young man of unusual talent and diligence and they must have been impressed with the enterprise and public spirit which he had shown in his vigorous efforts to improve the navigation of the rivanna in later years his fellow citizens of albe marle congratulated themselves on their foresight in giving him this early appointment and with it the opportunity to become more widely known the freeholders of his county elected him as soon as they very well could they retained him as their representative until he proceeded to larger tasks and they never let him be a prophet without honor at home both they and he had reason to be proud of this unfailing loyalty he afterwards claimed that he always disliked public life but there is no more evidence that he avoided it at

cultivating his farms service in the house of burgesses was not continuous but periodical and he was still a bachelor who could easily take the road he was not personally aggressive and did not crave power but he always set high value on the esteem of his fellows and at this stage he craved honor in that sense but proba in no other he had more than the little spice of ambition which h acknowledged he could not have failed to see that in this region the only real promise of distinction lay in the field of public affairs as has been well said to live and act like gentlemen was a thing once so common in virginia that nobody thought of noticing it lawyers achieved little prominence merely as lawyers patrick henry first attracted attention in a public case and all of the able practitioners in the gen eral court whom history remembers were statesmen as well science and philosophy were not professions here they were merely the avoca tions of gentlemen who must obtain support and gain prominence by other means years after jefferson entered the house of burgesses an eminent jurist sagely remarked the truth is that socrates himself would pass unnoticed and forgotten in virginia if he were not a public character jefferson was not yet a public character but he had taken a necessary step if he would ever become one he did not wait until the eve of the assembly to go to williams burg with his trusty jupiter he was there during most of the month of april attending to legal business and diverting himself at odd times early in may along with the other burgesses he took the oath in the council chamber at the capitol since this was his fost session the procedure probably impressed more than l it ever did afterwards the formalities required a good deal of walking to a fro but fortunately the distances were short after being sworn th burgesses returned to their own chamber whence they were sam moned again to the council room to attend the governor he then instructed them to go back and choose lcd peyton randolph the mace was lard on the table and botetourt was informed this was by no means the end lof it ho ever for they then attended his excellency agam and learned wrth

privileges of the house particularly freedom of speech and debate exemption from arrest and the protec tion of their estates these the governor solemnly promised to defend then slowly and with long pauses he made them a little speech the members finally returned to their own places and resolved that an address be presented to his excellency in response to his very affec tionate words these resolutions were drawn by the young burgess from albemarle all this was traditional procedure embroidered by deliberate de sign in this provincial setting the visible representative of a distant monarch was putting on as best he could a royal show he had rid den from the palace to the capitol in a superbly furnished coach of state which had been presented to him by the duke of cumberland uncle of the king and now bore the virginia arms jefferson and the other burgesses had no doubt watched it as six white horses drew it up the broad duke of gloucester street if the later foe of kings regarded this parade and all these reflec tions of regal splendor as unbecoming to a representative body which was jealous of its own prerogatives he gave no such suggestion in the first of his public papers the brief resolutions which he drew at the request of edmund pendleton were in the courtly style we need not be surprised to find in them such standardized expressions as a most humble and dutiful address his majestys sacred person and government and a lively sense of his royal favor more honeyed words than these appeared in the petition which the house of bur gesses had sent to george iii the year before when as a matter of fact it was asserting its own rights the iron hand was covered al most concealed by its velvet glove if jeffersons early draftsmanship is to be judged at all from these stereotyped resolutions it must be from the last of them in this he effected a felicitous juncture of loyalty with firmness thus aptly ex pressing the spirit of this polite but selfreliant group if any ques tions affecting great britain should arise he hoped they would be ussed on this ruling principle her interests and ours are in separably the same and finally he prayed that providence and e royal pleasure may long continue his lordship the happy ruler of a free and happy people goodwin williamsburg pp may ford i apr burgesses journals pp among the burgesses he had to content himself with this slight production for the ad dress which he drew soon thereafter was thought by the committee to follow the diction of the resolutions too strictly and not to amplify the subjects sufficiently the chief objector robert carter nicholas was then asked to draft the paper and in jeffersons opinion he did this with amplification enough some of the phrases of the younger man reappeared in less rhythmical form in the address which was adopted but this was a less distinguished piece of writing than his original resolutions whatever may be thought of them time showed much more convincingly that he was a better writer than the veteran nicholas or any other of the distinguished committeemen but this experience at the beginning of his legislative career left an unpleasant memory of chagrin time also showed that sensitiveness was charac teristic of his nature and constituted his chief personal weakness as a public man pendleton was undoubtedly aware of his diligence and of his skill in all sorts of paper work and probably anticipated that he would prove a useful committeeman as in the next few years he did jeffer son was appointed to two other committees in his first session but it is unlikely that he was immediately introduced into the inner circle of the legislators as has been claimed in formal sessions he was a silent member even after he had become much more mature he was always at his best in a small group and he did not like to raise his voice he never sat in a larger legislative body than the house of bur gesses the members must have crowded the small chamber and have had little elbow room if ever they were all there each of the fifty seven counties was entitled to two of them and three boroughs and the college of william and mary each had one nearly all of the lead ers whom jefferson had seen in action during his student days were still in evidence for the principle of continuity in office prevailed peyton randolph was even more dignified and stately since he had become a permanent presiding officer but jefferson found him affable and kind richard bland looked more than ever like a piece of parch ment robert carter nicholas was weighted with care being the treas urer of the colony but he was not yet at the point of offering his law practice to the young committeeman whom he had chagrined pat rick henry was dressing better but he was never anything but plain nor was he at all remarkable until he began to speak he generally remained inactive until a crisis arose bothering little with routine or ford i burgesses journals pp hilldrup fendleton p his committees were privileges and elections and propositions and grievances jefferson the virginian detail richard henry lee was a more even speaker though he never attained such heights and adroit pendleton was the best director of parliamentary affairs from charles city county where jefferson afterwards found a wife had come big benjamin harrison archibald cary whose daugh ter married thomas mann randolph of tuckahoe was there from chesterfield he was one of the smaller men jeffersons early client gabriel jones had crossed the mountains from augusta and his friend thomas nelson junior had come up from york more important than any of these in history and in jeffersons future career how ever was a splendid figure of a man from fairfax ordinarily george washington did not have much to say but he had come to the meet ing with something in his pocket it was probably at this session that jefferson met him for the first time but a decade passed before they knew each other very well though the new burgess from albemarle was one of the taller among many tall members he did not yet tower in this company and at his age he could hardly have been expected to he learned far more from their deliberations than he contributed to them these able vir ginians constituted an experienced vigorous and selfconfident group banded together by common interests and infused with a common spirit they did not need the spur of patrick henrys passionate ora tory at this meeting in closed sessions there was some dissent but on questions which affected their liberties as legislators and their rights as colonists they stood practically as one jefferson had an opportunity to observe this united front somewhat sooner than lord botetourt did on may by unanimous vote the burgesses passed certain resolves and on the next day the genial representative of the king who had sought to avoid just this eventual ity found it necessary to dissolve them despite all the lengthy cere monial at the beginning they remained in session for only ten days much turbulent water had gone over the dam since jefferson had eard patrick henry inveigh against the stamp act in this same cham ber and had witnessed in annapolis the rejoicings at the repeal of that obnoxious measure his relative richard bland had written a pamphlet entitled an inquiry into the rights of the british colonies which he read and from which he profited he himself never both ered however to follow bland in denying the virtual representation of the colomes in parliament which certain britishers had alleged as a among the burgesses justification for taxation that question was closed in his mind by the time that he began to speak of the connected chain of parliamentary usurpation of all the acts of usurpation which had followed the imposition of the stamp taxes the temporary suspension of the legis lature of the colony of new york left the deepest impress on his mind the previous assembly had addressed itself to this question and jefferson himself retained the conviction that never until they had surrendered their common sense would americans admit that they held their political existence at the will of parliament this issue arose again and became dominant in the end a more burning issue in this session was provided by the townshend duties voted by parliament two years earlier and still on the statute books these had been imposed at the instance of a showy and cyni cal british minister who derided the distinction between internal and external taxes since the obstreperous colonists had objected to the one he would accomplish a similar purpose by giving them the other by this time jefferson may already have reached the conclusion he afterwards proclaimed that the controversy over internal and exter nal taxes was a sham battle but in direct opposition to townshend he believed that parliament had authority to impose neither rather than a right to impose both the burgesses were not yet ready to say that they were opposed to laws designed to raise revenue under the guise of regulating external trade but they were willing to acquiesce in measures for preserving a necessary dependence at this juncture they were particularly concerned about what had happened in massachusetts the bay colony continued to be a seat of trouble jefferson himself said that the struggle which led to the american revolution began in each colony whenever the encroach ment was presented to it and that there was opposition in massachu setts earlier than in virginia also for various local reasons the inter nal struggle was more acute and the violence much greater there a board of customs commissioners was now seated in boston and thus the duties on glass paper colors and tea constituted a more visible encroachment as in a more famous instance several years later the massachusetts patriots appealed to the other colonies and jeffersons countrymen did not fail them if the virginians and the new eng landers were not the chief actors in the revolution he thought they were in february the house of representatives of massachusetts judging from his comments in his summary view ford i to beniamin waterhouse max ford x x n jefferson the virginian bay had sent to the other colonial legislatures a circular letter urging united action against the townshend duties at their next meeting the virginia assembly had petitioned the king and addressed the lords and commons and by direction the speaker of the burgesses wrote to the speaker of the massachusetts house that the virginia representatives could not but applaud them for their attention to american liberty furthermore he spoke of their own fixed resolution to concur with the other colonies in their application for redress judging from what had happened already botetourt had little reason to hope that his conciliatory manner would suffice to detach the virginians from their concert with their brethren to the north unfortunately the british authorities had chosen to make an issue of the massachusetts circular they had ordered it to be rescinded and the house of representatives had refused the secretary of state for the colonies lord hillsborough instructed hapless botetourt and the other provincial governors to dissolve any assembly which approved the circular furthermore some months before jefferson attended his first session parliament approved this policy and recommended the revival of an old statute which allowed the government to call to england for trial persons accused of treason outside of the kingdom the threat was specifically directed against the traitors in massa chusetts but the law could have been applied to patrick henry and peyton randolph just as well had it been seriously intended on the ninth day of their session the burgesses accepted the chal lenge without flinching they declared again that they not parlia ment had the right to levy taxes on the colony they also asserted the right of petition to the kang and the lawfulness of procuring the concurrence of the other colonies as usual they assured the king of their loyalty but in the same breath they asked him to avert the dangers and miseries which would ensue from the transportation of anyone to england to be tried botetourt had hoped to conciliate them and keep them silent but under his instructions he had now no choice he was dressed in scar let when he summoned them into his presence and said i have heard of your resolves and augur ill of their effect you have made it my duty to dissolve you and you are dissolved accordingly this was about noon on a wednesday with the greatest order and decorum the late representatives of the people went immediately to the apollo room of the raleigh tavern they elected peyton randolph apr burgesses journals p burgesses journals p and frontispiece wd p among the burgesses moderator and proceeded to transact highly important business in the best of form jefferson needed to do nothing but go along with this powerful current on the next day he put his name to the first sig nificant public paper that he ever signed this was what was known as an association and because of the great prestige of the colony and the historic eminence of the signers it became one of the more famous of its kind it was a nonimportation nonconsumption agreement based on part of a draft of george masons which washington had brought with him from fairfax county scholarly and patriotic mason who avoided legislative duties all he could was not there he had favored nonexportation also but the others were not yet prepared to go that far jefferson was among the great number of principal gentlemen of the colony including eightynine of the late representatives who signed the final report of a special committee after it was approved on thursday and then drank toasts to the king the governor and others he still regarded himself as a loyal subject but from this beginning he was wholly resolute in his defense of colonial rights he and the others promised that they would not import and that after september they would not buy any goods taxed by parlia ment for the purpose of raising revenue a similar agreement about a long list of other articles was to remain binding until the townshend act had been repealed at designated dates they also promised to cease to import wines and slaves they set up no machinery of en forcement however and this proved to be an ineffective measure it was an important gesture and threat nevertheless and jefferson took it more seriously than most unless lord botetourt intended to dispense with the assembly altogether and thus leave routine business unattended to he had to issue writs for a new election this he did in august and the elections were held in september as jefferson remembered the only casual ties were among the very few burgesses who had dared dissent from the opinions of the dominating group in the courthouse at char lottesville he himself was returned by the voice of the freeholders of albemarle his legislative career had lasted only ten days so far but having survived

sept ford i jefferson the virginian interrupted by no crisis and lasted about six weeks he served on more committees this time but like the others he was largely occu pied with routine affairs such as individual petitions and bills for the docking of entails on land so far as imperial relations were con cerned this meeting was serene and lord botetourt basked in the sunshine of popularity no penalties had been imposed on the bur gesses because of the actions of last may this was one of many in stances of the inconsistent and vacillating policy of the unstable min istry in england after having uttered unnecessary threats as ed mund burke pointed out the ministers now knelt to be kicked in virginia it was courtly lord botetourt who did the kneeling and the burgesses proceeded to bestow on him not a kick but the nearest thing to a caress that they could put in words in his opening address the governor made a most conciliatory an nouncement the british administration far from wanting to impose further taxes on america for purposes of revenue intended to pro pose at the next session of parliament that the duties on glass paper and colors be taken off he wisely failed to speak of tea and humor ously conceding that the present ministers were not immortal he admitted that their successors might attempt to undo their works but he did not believe the plan would fail as for himself he was willing to be declared infamous if he did not at all times in all places and upon all occasions exert every power to obtain satisfaction for the colonies the burgesses were enchanted and jefferson himself believed that the governor meant everything he said the response to such an important announcement was not entrusted to a young burgess who might possibly have claimed something more it was left to the sage veterans pendleton and nicholas they ex pressed gratitude and loyalty to the king and they undoubtedly voiced the prevailing sentiment about the governor himself your lordship s great regard and attention to the welfare and true inter est of this colony has before endeared you to us all but your gen erous and noble declarations upon this occasion demand our warm est and most grateful acknowledgments the governor had made lmself the hero of the hour and could hardly have been denied gen erous applause it seemed to thomas jefferson afterwards that this sort of thing smacked too much of humility and that while botetourt said all he is s ss sir pp m k b s e f gj ford among the burgesses could he could not say enough to certain critics of the ministry in the house of commons on the other hand and among them men who had opposed the townshend duties in the first place the speech and conduct of the lord of the bedchamber seemed absurd in the opinion of burke and others he had said far too much he had laid on parliament the odium for imposing burdens and had given all the credit for removing them to his king even lord north recognized the issue said he the language of america is we are the subjects of the king with parliament we have nothing to do that is the point at which the factions have been aiming upon that they have been shaking hands jefferson would have approved for he afterwards claimed that he held this position from the first but there is no record that he said so publicly until four years later and he believed that he was in advance of public opinions when he did meanwhile it was recognized in england as in virginia that botetourt was amiable and much beloved he was a man around whom pleasant stories gathered from his friend anne blair jefferson could have heard one which ought to have appealed to his musicians heart whether or not he loved a lord one summer evening as the blairs and their guests sat singing on their steps they saw a lantern and candle coming up the street the pedes trians soon stopped as though to listen and the music abruptly ceased whereupon a voice called out charming charming proceed for gods sake or i go home directly then all sprang up and the air echoed with pray walk in my lord no he would not do that but he would sit on the steps beside them this he did till the party broke up and the guests went home in december the speaker and the burgesses gave a party at the illuminated capitol to botetourt which jefferson was entitled to attend it was noted that the patriotic spirit which had given rise to the association of gentlemen in raleigh tavern was now manifested by the ladies at the capitol nearly a hundred of them came in homespun gowns they undoubtedly flut tered about his lordship who had no lady of his own at the palace but managed nevertheless to give splendid entertainment there jefferson was one of those who regarded the struggle with the british authorities as far from over the duty on tea remained and was supported by the ministry in parliament on the ground that the jan pari hist xvi may cavendish debates h esp in pari hist xvi the latter debate is dated

tax the practical incon venience to the colonies might now be slight as lord north said but the principle for which the more aggressive patriots had contended had been denied throughout the preliminaries of the revolution jef ferson kept principles clearly in mind and the action which he took in june illustrates the point he then signed another associa tion agreement which was to be binding until the offensive act of parliament had been totally repealed or a meeting of one hundred asso ciators had provided otherwise this agreement which was made by a large group of burgesses and local merchants during the spring ses sion of the assembly went further than that of the previous year by setting up county committees of enforcement it soon appeared how ever that these could not be genuinely effective since the spirit of association had everywhere de clin ed it was during this session that lord botetourt signed jeffersons commission as lieutenant of albemarle and chief commander

occupying it when war actually broke out and colonel jefferson then concerned himself diligently with military affairs he did not see much more of botetourt for in october the genial baron was gathered to his fathers jefferson was then in williamsburg attending the general court and no doubt was present at the funeral services in bruton church and in the college chapel where the remains were interred the ceremo nies were the most elaborate that had ever been seen in virginia and are reputed to have cost seven hundred pounds sterling also he was a member of the assembly which afterwards voted that an elegant statue of this muchmourned gentleman be erected in marble at pub lic expense this statue later became a landmark and caused the mem ory of his lordship to remain green in williamsburg jefferson afterwards viewed the death of botetourt which had seemed so tragically untimely as a fortunate event for the cause of the revolution he believed that if this conciliatory

association because of the defection of the northern provinces some people said a meeting of associators was called for decem ber but so few met that they could do nothing but adjourn until summer jefferson was in williamsburg that day and was prob ably numbered among these few he continued longer than most peo ple to be scrupulous about the agreement into which he had entered in the year as a prospective bridegroom he particularly wanted building materials and furnishings and fine clothes not until june however did he feel free to authorize his agent in england to purchase certain articles which had been previously prohibited as a public man he had now come into a barren period of all the sessions of the house of burgesses that he attended before his marriage his first was much the most exciting following the boston massacre there was a reaction ag ain st patriotic activities even in boston and the virginians had no other burning grievances for several years the time for him to appear as a rebel had not yet arrived but it was as inevitable as anything can be that he would take his stand against what he regarded as tyranny for the spirit of liberty was the essence of his mind during his early legislative career he said he made an effort for the emancipation of slaves which came to nothing whether he made or seconded an abortive motion which was not entered on the record or his memory was at fault in regard to the form of his proposal undoubtedly he already had a strong desire to mitigate the evils of slavery but as he reflected nothing liberal could then expect success he was still living in the dull monotony of a colonial subservience and both as a local patriot and a humanitarian he had to wait for a more propitious hour momentarily he had to combat ills created

reelected by the freeholders while his contemporary john walker was chosen in place of his father during this same year however jefferson de clined to serve longer on the county court and when the new

he began to practise law jefferson had given a name to the little mountain across the rivanna from shadwell and had started to graft cherry trees there he had translated little mountain into italian a language he was now familiar with and undoubtedly he pronounced the word in the italian manner a month after his twentyfifth birthday he made an agreement for leveling the top of this elevated place and by this time if not earlier he had decided to build a house there not yet however did he know who was going to live in it besides himself in the year he entered the house of burgesses laborers of his began to dig a cellar in the stiff mountain clay the work which he thus inaugurated he continued for ten or twelve years he returned to it as a new task a decade after that and the building of the mansion at monticello in its historic form proved to be little short of a lifetimes work nothing else that he ever did was more characteristic of him as a person and a mind in spirit he was preeminently constructive and he could not think of himself or of his house or of human so ciety as finished but he was not merely creating an architectural or intellectual monument he was a deeply domestic being making a home throughout his maturity his spirit ceaselessly roamed the uni verse searching out the good things in it but his heart was on his mountaintop and if his ghost now walks it is surely there few activities interested him more than building and it is unfor tunate that the scanty early records do not reveal just when this in first known reference garden book aug ibid p quoting account book may z lbid p jefferson the virginian terest was manifested first the natural supposition is that as an enthusiastic boy at home from school he watched the building opera tions that his father was carrying on at shadwell and observed peter jefferson at the drawingboard it is said that while he was in college he got his first work on architecture from an old cabinetmaker and as a law student he may have picked up ideas and books from rich ard taliaferro fatherinlaw of george wythe who was called an architect at the time and was certainly a builder the study of archi tecture for purposes of personal improvement was quite in accord with the tradition of the renaissance as perpetuated in england and in that country this was preeminently the age of the gendeman amateur in his own developing region jefferson became notable for his knowledge of the arts but his consuming interest in architecture began not with his concern for culture but with his desire to engage in actual construction or to help his friends do so he had to be his own designer and builder but he considerably surpassed amateur standards before he was through and he soon came to be regarded by his local contemporaries as an authority it is possible that he designed other houses before he did his own though the first full chapter of his architectural story was written in the bricks and mortar of monti cello to many at the time it must have seemed that his personal project was impracticable in deciding to establish a plantation seat on such a height he was following no precedent that could be found in vir ginia or in england for that matter and he appeared to be flying in the face of common sense the difficulties in carrying on construc tion in such a place were immense the woods were thick much grading had to be done in stubborn soil and besides the building materials themselves water had to be brought to the hilltop at first he had to figure with exactitude just how much of it was required his choice of a site does not show that he was an impractical theorist for in the course of time he actually worked out his problems it does show however that he had not disciplined his mind to the loss of imagination and events proved that in matters connected with his home he was least disposed to count the labor and the cost his choice also revealed a sensitiveness to natural beauty which he did not often express in words his eye like his mind sought an ex tended view from this spot he could see to the eastward an expanse of forested country

the spring jefferson was planting fruit trees on the southeast hillside spacing them properly in an almost ideal spot the excavations of were for the foundations of the first outbuilding by summer he had arranged for the molding and burning of brick and had set a man digging a well by early fall he had laid out on the north side of the mountain a park more than a mile in circumference had ordered chestnut rails to be mawled and had arranged for a friend who was sailing for england to buy articles for the house there his house plans were still tentative the first thing he had done was to get a few drawings of other dwellings crudely executed by other hands he could not hope to find satisfactory models in his immediate locality and even when he surveyed the entire province most of the private houses seemed to him ugly and uncomfortable he thought it fortunate that they were perishable they were generally of wood and in reaching his own early decision to use brick he had to combat a strong contemporary prejudice against it because of the belief that rain could less easily penetrate wooden walls he wanted to employ durable materials and to contribute to permanent improvement there were expensive mansions in virginia at that time rosewell which he visited so often was fabulously so and westover and carters grove which he must have known were places of note but after he had informed himself about what had been done in other lands he was convinced that the first principles of the art of building were unknown in the colony and that scarcely a model existed sufficiently

standards rather arbitrary all the domestic archi tecture of virg inia prior to the building of monticello cannot be thus dismissed with a wave of the hand he probably did not have quite such strong feelings about local houses in as he did when he defi nitely expressed them a dozen years later but at the very beginning his tastes and ambitions caused him to search for better examples else where it is not at all surprising therefore that he turned to books that was a co mm on practice when anyone wanted to build better than the average and he could not have been expected to blossom forth spon taneously as a creative designer in his middle twenties his distinction lay in the fact that he referred to more books than others did that he went beyond british works to more remote sources that he attained results which accorded with his own superior tastes and special needs his first collection of architectural works was notable in his locality and it was representative of more than one of the trends and fashions of his times he was most influenced however by english architects who had imitated palladio and by the great italian himself who had gone back to roman antiquity for his models and his rules thus did a freedomloving and forwardlooking american attach himself to a school which found its inspiration in the distant past and which now impresses one as dogmatic it may seem that some explanation is called for the facts themselves as they appeared in the last third of the eight eenth century can be left to speak for themselves but something may be said here in regard to the developing architectural philosophy of jefferson like most other men he was not all of a piece but in this instance the alleged inconsistency is more apparent than real liberty was never anarchy to him but freedom to seek the truth it seemed proper enough that there should be rules in architecture as there were laws in nature and rules were exceedingly useful to a young gentle man amateur on the edge of civilization who wanted to build a house if that structure had not been harmonious within itself restrained and symmetrically proportioned it would not have been a fitting habita tion for him or at least for the sort of man he aspired to be what he valued most in classical antiquity he prized in architecture simplicity serenity and reserve coupled with the sort of dignity which seemed f kimball jefferson architect pp listing his architectural books with probable dates of acquisition as an indication of the catholicity of his collection it may be noted that by and probably by he had a copy of chambers designs of chinese buildings furniture beginning at monticello appropriate to his majestic site for what he wanted he now turned not to the more monumental works of palladio but to the country style of his lesser villas he probably introduced himself to certain eng lish disciples of palladio such as james gibbs and robert morris before he made the acquaintance of the master himself one of the books by gibbs which he acquired among the first gave rules for architectural drawing and measurement which were better than those generally available to american builders and he followed these until he found others that seemed superior as his fathers son he took to mechanical drawing his procedure was that of the draftsman not the freehand artist and at this stage he drew not with pencil but wholly with ink his mind was mathematical and he had a penchant for precision this was one reason though not the only one why he was so greatly attracted to andrea palladio from the time that he discovered him a person of jeffersons classical training must have been impressed by the information that the italian had examined the stately monuments of old rome with unparalleled diligence and attention thus making himself the master of the noblest ideas of the ancients it was claimed that palladio walking through the rubbish had discovered the true rules of an art which till his time were unknown he probably seemed to his disciples the newton of architecture though jefferson never placed him quite that high in the works of this master however jefferson found rules for the proportions of the five orders along with various other measurements and as time went on he refigured the pro portions of his own house accordingly nor could he fail to perceive the kinship of spirit between the distinguished son of vicenza and himself in his first chapter palladio quoted vitruvius in regard to the chief desiderata in a building conveniency solidity and beauty then he said as for the beauty of an edifice it consists of an exact propor tion of the parts within themselves and of each part with the whole for a fine building ought to appear as an entire and perfect body for a general characterization see waterman pp he credits jeffer son with the authorship of a whole group of virginia houses in this style admittedly on the basis of circumstantial evidence however p james gibbs rules for drawing in architecture london he also had a copy of gibbs a book of architecture containing designs of buildings and ornaments london jefferson architect p of the various eds of the architecture of a palladio which he eventually owned he appears to have had that of leoni london by or before my own references are to the ed of leoni of prefatory note leoni palladio jefferson the virginian wherein every member agrees with its fellow and each so well with the whole that it may seem absolutely necessary to the being of the same there is here no denial of the freedom of the mind to reach its own conclusions but the strong hope is held out that the order and harmony which jefferson was seeking might be found the design of the main house which jefferson decided on about shows distinct traces of palladian influence but it went back to his own earlier more conventional and more practical plan of a central mass with wings to this he afterwards added octagonal bays or pro jections which may have been inspired by the select architecture of robert morris if he did draw plans for other dwellings before his own the best case can be made for the harrison place brandon which bears a striking resemblance to one of morriss plates there can be little doubt that he used some of the designs of this english architect as starting points at this and other times and from him he could also have received counsels of moderation in ornament i think a building well proportioned without dress will ever please said morris as a plain coat may sit as graceful and easy on a wellproportioned man but if you will be lavish in ornament your structure will look rather like a fop with a superfluity of gaudy tinsel than a real decoration fundamentally jefferson was austere he preferred chaste architec tural models and he worked out his proportions mathematically before he drew his plans in ink he was not an unbridled genius in this or any other field there was nothing lawless about him despite his pioneer ing bent he was unusually scholarly and painstaking and at the same time receptive and he had a rare gift of adaptation which constituted a form of originality he provided for his personal needs with in genuity and at monticello he did not slavishly follow any single guide the elevation which he drew before showed a central portico of two orders the stronger

in the november after the house at shadwell burned here he had parlor kitchen hall bedchamber and study all in one hither as tradition has it he brought his bride probably no part of the main house was completed at the time of his marriage they were still making and laying bricks after the declaration of independence and as late as jefferson contracted for stone columns the house was not wholly done in when the british rode up the mountain and it was remodeled extensively fifteen years after that he had only begun to create an architectural monument when he became a husband what mrs jefferson came to was only a mansion in the making on paper the house proper had five rooms on the first floor after the octagonal projections were added these consisted of a central parlor or saloon with a dining room and bowroom on one side and a bedroom and dressing room on the other the precise form of the second floor is uncertain but presumably the large library over the parlor was flanked with bedrooms according to palladio the conveniency of a house consisted in its suitability to the quality of its master in the common meaning of the term the house at monticello was not for some time a convenient one if it ever was really and amid all the clatter of construction it must have lacked the tranquillity which its owner so greatly prized those who knew the workings of his mind however

date when jefferson added the octagonal projections but they were in the completed house before he remodeled it t v r tt t w beginning at monticello been to monticello can recognize this for it was largely carried out in the course of time it was a country scheme such as had great vogue in eighteenthcentury england and was strongly reminiscent of pal ladio the idea was to connect the supporting buildings keeping them un der one roof for the convenience of the owner jefferson once flirted with the idea of having offices run all around the mountaintop but abandoned it as grandiose he now planned a succession of rooms in two lshaped blocks connecting with the main house and each ter minating in a square outbuilding after studying the lay of his land he decided to take advantage of the slope by sinking the service rooms be low the level of the main structure covering them with terraces and having them open outwards rather than upon the inner court his adaptation of the scheme was individual but in putting the meanest rooms out of sight he was following the counsel of the master palladio drew an analogy from the human body which contains some noble and beautiful members and others which though useful are ugly and dis agreeable then he reverently said but as our blessed lord has ordered our members so as to make the finest of them to be the most exposed to sight and concealing them that are not seemingly so just so we must contrive a b uilding in such a manner that the finest and most noble parts of it be the most exposed to publick view and the less agreeable disposed in byplaces and removed from sight as much as possible the major danger was that comfort and convenience would be sac rificed to stateliness by putting kitchen pantries woodhouses laun dries servants quarters and the like too far away there was reason to put them at a distance in those days for there were no screens and jefferson had plenty of domestic servants to carry things to and fro accordingly the housewifes objection to his placing the basement kitchen on the opposite side of the house from the dining room would not have been so quickly raised then as now on the other hand it would have been unfortunate if he had placed his stables under the northwest wing as he once planned actually he kept them at a greater distance and eventually used that wing chiefly for coaches and an ice house he did not get around to building his terraces until after the revolution nor did he put up at the turns the chinese temples he once considered or the octagons with domes like those at

a new creation america itself was that as he said later at least in comparison with europe it was built on a better plan the time for effective political planning was not yet come but he could create an appropriate setting for the sort of life he aspired to live whether he was in any strict sense original does not matter he was trying to bring to this new country the best wisdom of his age and in the attempt to solve his own problems he figured things out in advance with a diligence and exactitude which were unparalleled in his native society nothing was too small to excite his interest and homely matters con cerned him along with the artistic he had planted an orchard on the hillside below the southeastern outbuilding before he established bache lor quarters there he had set out ingrafted pears and apples cherry trees still to be inoculated peachstocks on which he intended to graft almonds and quinces and nectarines besides in the hollow he had planted pomegranates figs and walnuts along with peachstocks to be inoculated with apricots he was picking up bits of horticultural lore from his neighbors reading in a garden dictionary and planting bushels of clover seed but he had not worked out a full garden plan as yet his mind also turned to questions of landscaping but he never did have his retainers dig the rectangular flower beds behind the house which he showed on his general plan the open ground on the west seemed to him to call for a shrubbery and for this he drew up an impressive list at this stage there was more immediate need for thin ning trees removing undergrowth and domesticating the place gener ally nonetheless he wanted it to remain an asylum for wild animals except beasts of prey and he was already thinking of procuring a buckelk to be monarch of the wood somewhat later he did stock his park with deer but he was not able to do much with landscaping for many years the suggestions which he wrote down in his account book are of chief interest

for his sister jane along with mournful poetic bits from both latin and english as a literary being he was not untouched by the sentimental melancholy of his time but the sad reveries of this highly intellectual young planter could have been more easily explained by almost any observant person who had attained maturity the simplest statement of his case though not neces sarily a complete one is that he was in love and needed a wife it was fortunate that he did not have to wait for one much longer c xi attaining domestic felicity a bout the time that he moved to monticello and set up bachelor quarters in the first outbuilding there jefferson began to make regular visits to a place in charles city county called the forest where there was an attractive young widow to say that he paid court to her is to be quite precise for he lived in a courtly age and this shy and re served man tended to be formalistic in social matters as in architecture his attitude toward love and marriage was strictly conventional and his early manner toward women was stilted this was a real romance never theless and his marriage to martha wayles skelton on new years day ushered in the happiest period of his life external circum stances cast some shadows on the domestic scene during the next ten years but the atmosphere was one of unusual spiritual serenity he never had the slightest doubt that he was well mated this genuine love match was preceded by an uncertain affair which jefferson himself described afterwards as improper his relations with his neighbor mrs john walker were unknown or unnoticed at the time but they were widely advertised years later when he was a con spicuous target of scurrilous attacks as a notorious episode this story really belongs to his history as president when he was several times a grandfather but the events themselves fell within a period when he was young and only locally prominent the known facts should be stated here though their importance must not be exaggerated he had served as an attendant at the wedding of john walker and elizabeth betsey moore at the age of twentyone jack walker was not quite the same sort of friend as john page and dabney carr but for the history of the whole affair extending to the year see append iii jefferson the virginian he had been intimate with jefferson from their days at maurys school they had been at college together and they loved each other jack said dr thomas walker of castle hill his father was one of peter jeffersons executors he advanced some of his own money to his ward when the latter went to william and mary though there is no reason to suppose that this was not repaid betsey was the daughter of colonel bernard moore and two of her brothers were at the college in jeffer sons time the young couple eventually settled down at belvoir on the old nicholas meriwether estate five or six miles from shadwell jefferson not only continued to be intimate with walker he gave elab orate advice to one of betseys brothers about the study of law and became good friends with colonel moore from whom he got garden items and at whose home chelsea in king william county he visited it was in the year he was twentyfive that jefferson made a mistake he was then unmarried full of physical strength and vigor and for four months his friend was away from home john walker was attend ing a conference with the indians at fort stanwix and acting as a clerk of the virginia delegation of which his father was a member before he left he made his will naming jefferson first among his executors and he entrusted his wife and baby daughter to this friends special care it was just after his return that jefferson was elected to the house of burgesses with dr thomas walker a generation afterwards john said that during his absence jeffersons conduct towards mrs walker was improper and the president of the united states candidly admit ted to certain particular friends that at one time it was singling

that mrs walker told her husband about jeffersons designs on her when he was at a safe distance she unfolded a lurid story of base transactions in and when he was still a bachelor and extending into when he had been for some years a married man as walker wrote it all down fifteen or twenty years after he got the report it was a disgusting tale which bore the marks of gross and will ful exaggeration whatever may have been the cause in the absence of other testimony such an incredible story cannot be accepted in detail all we can be sure of is that jefferson made ad vances of some sort to his friends wife while he himself was single that he deeply regretted his actions afterwards and that he accepted all the blame he may possibly have erred more than once in his youth ful ardor but this sensitive man was not bold toward women and the awkward maneuvers which mrs walker reported suggest none of the accomplishments of a rake he was much more in character as a de voted husband and kind father than as an aggressive lover and it is hard to believe that he would have persisted in the face of rebuffs at any age he generally observed the proprieties almost to the point of stiffness he was notably loyal to his friends and there is no reason whatever to question his complete fidelity to his own wife he would have been in a safer position however if he had got her sooner than he did when he was nearly twentynine in virginia as a rule people did not wait as long as jefferson did to marry his delay had distinct advantages besides some dangers for it enabled him to devote himself to his studies and to his profession to a degree which would have been difficult in wedded life by die year that the house at shadwell burned however he was aware that as a bachelor he had missed many joys his friend and brotherinlaw dabney carr had not yet proceeded as far along the road to profes sional success and public prominence as he had and may have had a harder tune making

would acquire one readymade for martha wayles skelton had one she was five and a half years younger than he and at eighteen had married bathurst skelton who had followed him in college her son john was bom when she was nineteen and less than a year after that she became a widow and went back to her fathers place in charles city county west of williamsburg after a decent interval she was doubtless in the provincial capital for part of the social season and by the autumn of jefferson had probably met her there at all events he gave jupiter money to buy hair powder and buckles for him that fall and he bought many tickets for the play perhaps he visited the forest before december beyond a doubt he was there then as he was regularly during the next year tipping the servants with unfailing regularity and conducting himself generally in a handsome manner early in he made inquiries about the coat of arms of his own family though he did so with private display of wit he asked a merchant friend who oscillated between virginia and england to search the heralds office for him i have what i have been told were the family arms he said but on what authority i know not it is possible there may be none if so i would with your assistance become a purchaser having sternes word for it that a coat of arms may be purchased as cheap as any other coat he was in no parsimonious mood however and he did not scorn the costly apparatus of life he purposed to carry on his line in a distinguished manner and he was aware of the fact that martha belonged to a wealthy family she was

that he later used a seal bearing the motto rebellion to tyrants is obedience to god though this had no connection with any coat of arms attaining domestic felicity son thought more important still he had acquired a large landed estate along with debts which were considerable but seemed to be amply covered jefferson and others found him a most agreeable man and he conducted his extensive affairs in a generous and optimistic spirit her mother had died soon after martha was bom leaving no other children she was of the prominent eppes family which had been asso ciated to some degree with the early jeffersons and by her marriage settlement she had assured her descendants of certain inherited lands and slaves there were three other girls in the family the daughters of another of john wayless wives one of these girls elizabeth who played an important part in the family life of jefferson later on may already have married francis eppes first cousin of martha and an other was engaged john wayles had three wives and lost all of them the third one was the widow of reuben skelton martha had added to the genealogical confusion by marrying his brother bathurst that alliance had proved shortlived and by the early months of jefferson wanted to offer her another he found her responsive but he was discouraged at first by his failure to solve the housing problem in june his prospect of becoming more regularly a pater familias were much brighter and he then made an important change in the order he had previously given to his merchant friend by that time he had seen a fortepiano and he now wanted that sort of instru ment instead of a clavichord purposing to give this to martha he desired the case to be of fine mahogany solid not veneered and the workmanship very handsome also he ordered for himself some stock ings of the best quality along with a large umbrella with brass ribs covered with green silk and neatly finished he was impatient for these articles particularly the piano and predicted rather humorously that his orders would be somewhat enlarged thereafter it was at this date also that he sought a builder to help him at monticello things were moving on the mountain but not as fast as he liked and he himself could not be there all the time he may not yet have set up in his books his account with the estate of bathurst skelton but about this time he opened another one pre maturely this was for john skelton son of bathurst with himself as guardian in behalf of martha his wife he made an entry on account autobiography ford i see appendix i d for
